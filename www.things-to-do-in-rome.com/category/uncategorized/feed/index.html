				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hi, welcome to my website about Rome.</strong> Here you can find really a lot of information about all the things you can see and visit in Rome. Just click on the menu above or on the site categories on the right and you will be taken straight to my posts about that subject.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Paul-ilford-smile.jpg"><img class=" size-medium wp-image-23 alignright" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Paul-ilford-smile.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Paul den Arend" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>My name is Paul. <strong>I work as a tour guide in Rome</strong> and spent 8 years of my life living in this amazing city. Not only have I guided many groups through the city, I have come to know it intimately. I know which places people like and which ones are better avoided. I found out where it is busy at what time and how to avoid the lines.</p>
<p><strong>On this site you will find interesting stories about the Colosseum, Saint Peter&#8217;s Basilica and the Vatican</strong>. I&#8217;ll show what to look for when you visit all the well-known monuments, but I also take you to the unknown gems, the places very few tourists know about. You will find out what places to avoid and how not to fall for the tourist traps.</p>
<p>And, if you like to take the time to read all my stories, <strong>you can buy one of my guidebooks and read all the information on this site in one book</strong>. Just click on the store link in the menu or click on one of my books in the right sidebar.</p>
<p>Please feel free to comment anywhere or send me a message.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>

The church looks nicer from the outside than from the inside. It is worth it to walk up to the top of the Spanish steps though, because the view is amazing.</p>

It was placed here in 1501 and ever since Romans place political pamphlets here, commenting on current affairs. Recently, the statue has been restored and people seem less keen to put their pamphlets here.</p>
