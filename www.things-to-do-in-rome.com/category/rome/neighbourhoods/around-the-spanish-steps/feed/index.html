				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This park is called the Villa Borghese. It was the first of its kind in Rome. In 1901 it became property of the state. In the park you can find museums, foreign academies, a zoo, an artificial lake and an amphitheatre. It is a pleasant park where a lot of Romans come on Sundays to stroll around with their children.</p>
<p>The most important museum you can find here is the Galleria Borghese, which houses the famous baroque statues of Bernini. It is something really worth visiting, but you have to make a reservation in advance, because the museum is small and a lot of people want to go there. There is no point going there without tickets.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Trevi Fountain is the most famous fountain of Rome. It was made famous by Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini’s film ‘La Dolce Vita’, in which Anita Ekberg takes a bath in the fountain with Marcello Mastroianni watching. I would advise against jumping in now, as it is continuously watched by policemen who prevent people from reenacting the scene. The best time to visit the fountain is two o’clock in the morning. Then, the tourists are all gone and spotlights illuminate the fountain beautifully. The police are still there though.</p>
<p>The fountain was built halfway through the 18th century. It was paid for with a tax on wine. The story goes that the Pope who instituted this tax couldn’t leave his house without eggs and tomatoes being thrown at him. In the end his investment paid off though. Just look at the number of tourists looking at the fountain (unless you are here at four in the morning). The fountain is located against Palazzo Poli. It was designed by Bernini, but the plan was only executed fifty years after his death by Nicola Salvi. Bernini never saw the fountain. The water comes from the Aqua Virgo, which runs under Via Condotti and ends up here.</p>
<p>The central figure is the god of sea Oceanus. On both sides of Oceanus you can see two Tritons who are taming two horses. One is wild and the other one is quiet. This is a reference to the two shapes the sea can take. The water from the fountain flows from here to many other fountains in the city, like the ones on Piazza Navona.</p>
<p>Maybe you have seen people throwing coins in the fountain. According to legend, if you throw a coin with your right hand over your left shoulder (not the other way around), you will return to Rome. If you throw two coins you will also fall in love with an Italian, but watch out, if you throw three, you will marry one. Every year, about 90.000 euro worth of coins is thrown into the fountain. This money is used to keep the fountain in good shape.</p>
<p>The church in front of the fountain is called the Santi Vicenzi ed Anastasio. In this church the hearts of almost all 17th, 18th and 19th century Popes are being kept. This macabre tradition was discontinued by Pope Pius X in the beginning of the 20th century.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Santa Maria del Popolo is an Augustinian church on Piazza del Popolo. It is very small, but contains work by world-famous artists, like Bernini and Caravaggio. The facade was redone in Baroque style by Bernini in 1660.</p>
<p>Piazza del Popolo was the first thing people would see of Rome as they entered the City. The northern gate was here and most visitors and pilgrims to the city entered here. The gate still stands, but the city now expands much further north.</p>
<p><span id="more-419"></span></p>
<h2>The Apse and Dome of Santa Maria del Popolo</h2>
<figure id="attachment_319" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image238.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-319" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image238.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="The Apse and Dome of Santa Maria del Popolo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Apse and Dome of Santa Maria del Popolo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Inside, the dome was decorated with a mosaic by Raphael which represents the creation of the world. The apse was designed by renaissance architect Bramante with a stained glass window by Guillaume de Marcillat.</p>
<p>Pinturicchio, favorite painter of the Borgia Pope Alexander VI, painted the vault, including a coronation of the Virgin.</p>
<h2>Cerasi Chapel</h2>
<figure id="attachment_321" style="width: 500px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image240.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-321" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image240.jpg?resize=500%2C661" alt="Conversion of Saint Paul" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Conversion of Saint Paul</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_322" style="width: 599px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image241.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-322" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image241.jpg?resize=599%2C776" alt="Crucifixion of Saint Peter" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Crucifixion of Saint Peter</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the left side of the apse you can find the Cerasi Chapel, which holds two paintings by Caravaggio. One is the Crucifixion of Saint Peter. Peter is, on his own request, crucified upside down. He did not think he was worthy enough to be crucified the same way as Christ. The other painting shows the Conversion of Saint Paul on the road to Damascus. Paul, who used to persecute Christians, falls from his horse on the road to Damascus as he sees the light and is converted to Christianity. Between the two paintings by Caravaggio is an altarpiece by Annibale Carracci, an important painter in the baroque style. See how different the work of Caravaggio is from the work of Carracci? Caravaggio is a master of playing with light and dark. Look also at the face of Saint Peter and see how much life there is his face. These are two masterpieces.</p>
<h2>Chigi Chapel</h2>
<figure id="attachment_323" style="width: 603px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image242.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-323" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image242.jpg?resize=603%2C413" alt="Chigi Chapel" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Chigi Chapel</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the left side of the church you can find the Chigi chapel, which was started by Raphael and finished by Bernini. Bernini also added the statue of Habakkuk and the Angel and Daniel and the lion.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At number 68 in the Via Condotti you can see the house of the smallest sovereign state in the world. It is the house of the Knights of Malta. The order was founded in 1113 to care for the sick and wounded in the holy land. The grandmaster, who resides here, is treated like a head of state in Catholic countries. If you want to join you have to prove that your family is at least two centuries part of the nobility and that sixteen of your forefathers were of noble birth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Via Condotti is probably the most expensive street in Rome. All the Italian and International fashion houses keep shop here. If you want to spot an Italian movie star or reality show contestant, this is the place. It is a great place for window shopping (or real shopping if you have the buying power). Even if you don’t have the cash to buy a Gucci bag or Valentino suit, I can recommend you visit one of the shops. They all look beautiful from the inside. The name of the street comes from the aqueduct which runs below it, the Aqua Virgo.</p>

He is buried in Rome in the protestant graveyard outside the city walls, which is a nice little excursion if you like to see something different when in Rome. Make sure to check the actual opening times though, the graveyard is often closed.</p>

It was made by Pietro Bernini, the father of the famous Bernini. Pietro had obviously less talent than his son. The fountain is a bit below the level of the street, because otherwise the water pressure would have been insufficient.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Obelisk on top of the Spanish Steps in front of the church is a Roman imitation of an Egyptian obelisk. We know this because the hieroglyphs are copied badly from the obelisk that stands on Piazza del Popolo. The Roman sculptor put some of the signs upside down. Originally obelisks were symbols of the rays of the sun. The ancient Egyptians worshipped the sun. Even though the obelisks are pagan symbols, the Popes kept them. You will always see a cross on top of the obelisk though, representing the prevalence of Christianity over Paganism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Spanish Steps are by far the most famous steps in Rome and maybe the world. The steps were built in 1726. It is strange that the steps are called Spanish steps, because they were financed by a French ambassador. He wanted to provide a nice walkway to the French Church on top of the hill, the Trinità dei Monti. Before, there were only a few small paths up. In the end they became known as the Spanish steps, because the Piazza below is called Piazza di Spagna. This is because the Spanish Embassy to the Holy See is located on the Piazza. You can see the Spanish flag hanging from a big palazzo close to the column.</p>
<p>The steps consist of ten times twelve steps and have three terraces, which is a reference to the trinity, after which the church on top is named. At the top there is a very nice view of Piazza di Spagna and also the rest of Rome. The dome of Saint Peter’s can be seen. Every spring, many flowers are put on the steps, which make them look even more amazing.</p>
<p>Once, there was a model market on the steps. Painters and sculptors would come here to pick their models. During the touristic high season the steps will be filled with people. Piazza di Spagna can get extremely busy. I always recommend people to do a very very late night tour to see these kinds of monuments without the masses of people. If you pass here at 2 AM on a warm summer night, you will have a really different experience than at 4PM when you can’t see the steps because of the masses of people. The same goes for Trevi Fountain. Go at 2AM, really, you’ll thank me for it (especially if you have gone during the day in the high season).</p>
