				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The San Clemente is one of the most interesting churches in Rome. It consists of three layers. Under the main church from the 12th century you can find another church from the 4th century and under that there is an old roman house with a sanctuary to Mithras. The first church on the middle level was erected in the 4th century and named after the 4th Pope Saint Clement, who used to live on this spot. This church was partly destroyed in the 11th century by a Norman conqueror and then a new church was built on top of the remains of the others.</p>
<p>Clement was banished to the Crimea by the Romans because of his success in converting people to Christianity, but even from there he kept on converting lots of people. He then was given an ultimatum: Or worship the Roman gods or die. He decided to continue converting and was then thrown into the Black sea, tied to an anchor. Afterwards, the sea would open once a year, so people could erect a shrine and worship Clements relics. On one of these occasions a widow lost her only son, but he was found alive and well a year later when the sea opened again.</p>
<p><span id="more-532"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_327" style="width: 627px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image245.jpg"><img class="wp-image-327 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image245.jpg?resize=627%2C836" alt="Interior of the San Clemente" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Interior of the San Clemente</figcaption></figure>
<p>The columns in the nave of the upper church came from the Forum Romanum. They were taken from other buildings and reused here. This happened often in the middle ages.</p>
<p>You can also see a Schola Cantorum, which divides the choir from the rest of the church. This is actually a structure from the 6th century and precedes the upper church. You can see typical early Christian motives like fish, doves and vines.</p>
<h2>Mosaics in the San Clemente</h2>
<figure id="attachment_328" style="width: 624px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image246.jpg"><img class="wp-image-328 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image246.jpg?resize=624%2C461" alt="Mosaics in the San Clemente" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Mosaics in the San Clemente</figcaption></figure>
<p>There is a mosaic on the triumphal arch above the altar from the 12th century. In the upper right corner you can see Clement with an anchor. The remains of Clement and the anchor were transported to this church in the 9th century. On the left you can see the apostle Paul together with Saint Lawrence.</p>
<p>The mosaic on the apse depicts the triumph of the cross. You can see the tree of life. The twelve doves on the cross symbolizes the twelve apostles, just like the twelve sheep below. Around them you can see the people that work in the vineyard of the lord surrounded by monks, slaves, sheep, peacocks, which symbolizes immortality, and birdcages.</p>
<h2>Chapel of Saint Catherine of Alexandria</h2>
<figure id="attachment_329" style="width: 624px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image247.jpg"><img class="wp-image-329 size-full" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image247.jpg?resize=624%2C468" alt="Chapel of Saint Catherine of Alexandria" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Chapel of Saint Catherine of Alexandria</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the chapel of Saint Catherine of Alexandria you can see a fresco by Masolino da Panicale from Florence. Catherine was the daughter of an Egyptian king who refused to marry Emperor Maxentius, because she was a Christian (and he was not). Maxentius cannot get her to worship the roman gods, even after he sends pagan priest and philosophers to convince her. She converts them instead. The Emperor then condemned them to be burned alive. Catharina then criticizes Maxentius because of this, who then condemns her to death by starvation. In the prison a pigeon brings Catharina food. She is then tortured on a wheel with sharp pins, but the wheel broke. Then she was decapitated and from her wounds milk flowed instead of blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first scene depicts the dispute between Catharina and the pagan priests.</li>
<li>The second scene shows Catherine’s missionary work.</li>
<li>Here she converted Maxentius’ wife.</li>
<li>In the next scene she is rescued by an angel while being tortured on the wheel.</li>
<li>The last scene depicts her decapitation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Lower Church</h2>
<p>After you buy a ticket you can visit the Lower Church. This church was built in the 4th century. You can see inscriptions from pagan times and from Christian times. You can also see the remains of some 11th century frescos. Stories from the life of Clement are depicted, like the story of the boy who stayed a year under the sea and was unharmed, because Clement protected him.</p>
<figure id="attachment_330" style="width: 622px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image248.jpg"><img class="wp-image-330 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image248.jpg?resize=622%2C358" alt="Fresco of Saint Alessio" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fresco of Saint Alessio</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the nave you can see some more damaged frescoes from the 9th century. You can see Pope Leo IV and also the legend of Saint Alessio, who left his bride on his wedding night to go on a pilgrimage. When he came back, nobody recognized him and he lived like a beggar under the stairs of his parental home. Only after his death a Pope recognized him in a dream.</p>
<p>On the left side you pass the grave of Saint Cyrillus, the apostle of the Slavic people. He created the Slavic or Cyrillic alphabet, to properly translate the bible into the Slavic languages. It was he who gave the remains of Saint clement to the church and that is why his is buried here. Often Greek-Orthodox priests or monks visit his grave.</p>
<h2>Roman House with Mithraeum</h2>
<figure id="attachment_331" style="width: 622px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image249.jpg"><img class="wp-image-331 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image249.jpg?resize=622%2C413" alt="Mithraeum under San Clemente" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Mithraeum under San Clemente</figcaption></figure>
<p>After you pass the grave you can enter the third level. Below the lower church is an ancient Mithraeum. The cult of Mithras was very popular in Rome and was a big rival of the new Christian cult. It was very popular under Roman legionnaires. Mithras was always worshipped in a natural cave with a ceiling representing heaven. In the ceiling you can see 11 holes, representing 7 planets and 4 seasons. Mithras was born from a rock on the 25th of December. It is interesting to know that the cult of Mithras is older than Christianity. Some shepherds were present at his birth. Apollo, the god of light told Mithras to kill the cosmic bull, to save humanity. When Mithras was fighting the bull the god of evil sent a snake and a scorpion, who bit the bull in his testicles to prevent him from procreating. All animal and plant life was created by the flow of the bulls’ semen. After the scorpion was crushed, its blood created all evil. In the sanctuary there is a prominent picture of Mithras and the bull. You can see the place followers of the cult used to sit on both sides of the cave. Here they had banquets with meat and blood from a bull, to celebrate Mithras’ victory. Afterwards, this space was used as catacombs, where Christians were buried. You can also visit the remains of a 1st century house. You can hear water run, but nobody knows where it comes from. It is probably an ancient roman waterway.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santi Quattro Coronati is a very interesting but relatively unknown church. It used to be a fortress and monastery, which protected the Lateran palace, where the Popes used to live before they moved to southern France and then to the Vatican. It was built in the 4th century and rebuilt in the 11th century after the Normans attacked. Now, Augustinian nuns live here. The floor is especially notable, because at least 200 antique marble stones were used to make the pattern.</p>
<p><span id="more-530"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_187" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image112.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-187" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image112.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Inside the Quattro Coronati" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Inside the Quattro Coronati</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the fresco on the apse the two stories of the Quattro Coronati are represented. Quattro Coronati means the four crowned ones. This refers to either 4 sculptors who refused to sculpt a statue of the pagan god Asclepius, who were then thrown in led coffins into the sea. The other four crowned ones were four soldiers who refused to carry out this sentence and who were tortured using sharp, red hot crowns. In the 17th century, when the fresco was painted, people had forgotten to which four crowned martyrs the church was dedicated so both groups were painted.</p>
<figure id="attachment_188" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image113.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-188" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image113.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="The Chapel of Sylvester" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Chapel of Sylvester</figcaption></figure>
<p>The highlight of the church is the chapel of Pope Sylvester with frescos from the 13th century. You get to this chapel by going outside the church to the courtyard, then enter the monastery and ring a bell next to the fence. A nun will then appear and you will give her a few euros. She will then buzz you in and you can go and see the chapel. Please do not skip this, if only for the experience.</p>
<p>The chapel is very small and is filled with frescoes from the 13th century. They show the legend of Pope Sylvester, a Pope who was appointed by Emperor Constantine. According to legend he converted Constantine to Christianity. He lived on a mountain as a hermit close to Rome. Constantine was suffering from the plague at the time as a punishment for having persecuted Christians. Roman senators advised him to bath in the blood of 3000 children. He couldn’t bring himself to kill so many children and in a dream he is visited by Saint Peter and Paul who tell him to go and visit Sylvester and enjoy a much healthier bath: baptism.  When he visited Sylvester he showed him pictures of the men (Saint Peter and Paul) that visited him in his dream and Constantine was impressed. He was then healed from the plague and became the first Christian Emperor. The next seven days he issued a lot of laws promoting Christianity and on the eighth day he personally laid the foundation of Saint Peter’s Basilica.</p>
<p>In the fresco above the entrance you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>The senators of Rome with Constantine in front of the mothers with the children in whose blood he was supposed to bath</li>
<li>Constantine in bed who dreams about Peter and Paul</li>
<li>Constantine on the road to the mountain where Sylvester lives</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_189" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image114.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-189" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image114.jpg?resize=300%2C213" alt="Peter &amp; Paul visit Constantine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Peter &amp; Paul visit Constantine</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the left wall you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constantine meeting Sylvester</li>
<li>Sylvester shows Constantine a picture of Peter and Paul</li>
<li>Constantine being baptized</li>
<li>Constantine makes Sylvester Pope and kneels in front of him and offers him the Lateran Palace</li>
<li>Sylvester arrives in Rome at the Lateran palace.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the right wall you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>The miracle of the bull. Jewish scribes argue with Sylvester while Constantine and his mother Helena attend. The Jewish scribes show the power of their religion by whispering something in the ear of a bull, who immediately dies. Sylvester then whispers the word Jesus in his ear, after which the bull comes back to live. Helena is instantly converted to Christianity.</li>
<li>Sylvester tames a dragon.  A dragon lived on the forum, which poisoned the air with his fumes. Sylvester prays to Mary and faces the dragon alone, armed with a silk thread and a statue of Christ. The dragon is paralyzed by the power of Christ and lets himself be bound with the silk thread. The dragon was then hit over his head with the statue and buried under the forum. The dragon probably symbolized an outbreak of Malaria in Rome.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next to Saint John in Lateran, on the other side of the street, you can find the Scala Sancta. This building houses the holy steps. The building was built by Domenico Fontana in 1589. According to legend Christ climbed the steps in this building on the Friday of his death, going to Pontius Pilatus’ house. The mother of Emperor Constantine, Saint Helen, would have taken the steps from Pilatus’ house in Jerusalem in 326 AD. This story only starts being told in the 7<sup>th</sup> century though. Only faithful are allowed to ascend the steps, and only on their knees. The steps are protected by wood and on some places you can see some blood, allegedly from Christ.</p>
<p><span id="more-528"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_185" style="width: 225px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image110.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-185" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image110.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="Inside the Scala Sancta" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Inside the Scala Sancta</figcaption></figure>
<p>At the top of the steps is the Sancta sanctorum, the holiest of holy, which is never accessible. It contains very precious relics, like a portrait of Jesus painted by angels, some mothers milk from the virgin Mary, a piece of Christ’s shoe and some leftovers from the last supper. Once Christ’s foreskin was kept here, but it was stolen during the sack of Rome in 1527.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have time try to go and see the Baptistery. It is a small building just outside St. John Lateran. It is the oldest of Rome and according to legend this is the place Emperor Constantine would have been baptized by Pope Sylvester I. The current building dates from 432. Its octagonal shape would influence the building of all later Baptisteries all over the world. The octagonal shape represents the 8th day of creation, when a man is created again by being baptized. It is built on the baths of the old house of Faustina, the second wife of Constantine. The basin is an old roman bathtub made from green basalt. The basin had to be big, because in this time adults were converted to Christianity and had to be baptized by submerging their whole body in water.</p>
<p>You can see frescoes with scenes from the life of John the Baptist and also scenes from the life of Constantine. The mosaic is from the 5th century. The deer represents the renewal of life. The deer blows water towards snakes in holes in the earth to get them out and trample them, just like god uses water to baptize people and drive out evil. The deer always looks for water to drink which represents humanities need for baptism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The St. John Lateran is one of the most important churches in Rome. The area on which it is built once belonged to the Lateran family. Their property was confiscated because they had conspired against Emperor Nero and had sheltered Christians in their home. In the fourth century AD it was given by Emperor Constantine to the Pope, who built a church there. The Popes lived here also until 1305.</p>

<h2>The Lateran Palace</h2>
<figure id="attachment_289" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image209.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-289" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image209.jpg?resize=300%2C231" alt="Lateran Palace" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Lateran Palace</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Lateran Palace is attached to the church. It was built in 1586 and designed by Domenico Fontana. The Popes used to live on this spot before they moved to Avignon in France in the middle ages. When they came back, the Lateran Palace was uninhabitable so they moved to the Vatican. In the 16th century the ruins were taken down and this new palace was built.</p>
<h2>The Cathedral</h2>
<p>The Basilica is the actual church. It is the main cathedral of Rome. Until 1870 all Popes were crowned in this church. Emperor Constantine has personally put the first stone down. There is little left of the original cathedral, thanks to the sack of Rome by the Vandals, an earthquake in the 9th century and two fires in the 14th century. On the facade you can see 12 enormous statues. They are 7 meters high. You can see Christ, John the Baptist, John the evangelist and various Church Fathers. The facade was designed by Alessandro Galilei in 1735.</p>
<h2>The Interior of St. John Lateran</h2>
<p>The interior was designed by the influential baroque artist Borromini in 1646. Borromini was the great rival of Bernini and a very difficult person to work with. His architecture is on a very high aesthetic level though. One day he saw a kid destroying some marble blocks on purpose. He had him beaten up by his workmen who proceeded to kill the boy. The Pope was not pleased, but pardoned Borromini because he needed him to finish the cathedral.</p>
<p>The bronze doors were taken from the Curia, the senate building, on the Forum. The right door was made in the year 2000 by Floriano Bodini and is only opened every 25 years during a holy year. In the vestibule, on the left side, you can see a statue of Emperor Constantine, the founder of the church. It was taken from his bathing houses.</p>

<p>In the nave of the church you can see enormous statues on the left and right. They represent the 12 apostles and were made by students of Bernini. You can recognize the apostles by their attributes. Matthew is holding a money bag, Bartholomew is holding a knife.</p>
<h2>The Ceiling of St. John Lateran</h2>
<figure id="attachment_292" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image212.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-292" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image212.jpg?resize=300%2C223" alt="Ceiling of St. John Lateran" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ceiling of St. John Lateran</figcaption></figure>
<p>The coffered ceiling is from 1585. You can see many doves, which represent the family crest of Pope Innocent X, who commissioned the interior of the church.</p>
<figure id="attachment_293" style="width: 200px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image213.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-293" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image213.jpg?resize=200%2C300" alt="The Papal Altar" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Papal Altar</figcaption></figure>
<p>The papal altar is placed in a central spot, just like in Saint Peters. Only the Pope can say mass here. You can see a gothic canopy above the altar with 12 frescos from the 14th century. In the two silver busts behind the fence on the canopy the heads of Saint Peter and Paul are being kept. Just before the altar is the tomb of Pope Martin V, the Pope who brought the renaissance to Rome. He was the first Pope to rule alone after a string of rivaling Popes in the late middle ages.</p>
<figure id="attachment_294" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image214.jpg"><img class="wp-image-294 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image214.jpg?resize=300%2C250" alt="Fresco's by Cavalier d’Arpino and Apse Mosaic" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fresco&#8217;s by Cavalier d’Arpino and Apse Mosaic</figcaption></figure>
<p>The transept has frescos painted by Cavalier d’Arpino. They were painted around the year 1600 and show episodes from the history of this church. You can see the baptism of Emperor Constantine and the founding of San Giovanni.</p>
<p>The mosaic in the apse represents Christ as a savior. It is from the 4th century and the first public representation of Christ. Legend has it the mosaic of Christ was made by angels. The rest of the mosaic is from the 13th century. To the left of the cross you can see Mary, a Pope, Saint Francis of Assisi, Peter and Paul. To the right you can see John the Baptist, Saint Anthony of Padova, John the evangelist and Andreas the apostle.</p>
