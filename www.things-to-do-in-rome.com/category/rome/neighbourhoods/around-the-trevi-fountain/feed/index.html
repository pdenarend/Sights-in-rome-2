				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Piazza della Repubblica was once part of the huge baths of Diocletian. The half circular shape of the piazza still reflects this. This part used to be the entrance hall to the baths. Parts of the actual baths are still standing on one side of the piazza. Bathing was very important for the ancient Romans and was an important part of everybody’s life. Everybody went to the baths. Men, women, slaves and masters, poor people and very rich. Of course everybody had different hours on which they were allowed to go to the baths. Personal hygiene was very important. The Romans believed in the idea of a healthy mind in a healthy body. Rome had a lot of very imposing baths, because all of the one million people that lived in ancient Rome went to bathe. It was also a place to do business meetings or to meet up with friends. Besides bathing, you could also get a massage, go to the gym or have a relaxing walk in the gardens. Of course, also stories are known of theft, murder and orgies that took place in the baths. In Pompeii archeologists found this inscription: ‘Bathing, wine and sex wreck our body, but what is life without bathing, wine and sex’.</p>

<p>The fountain in the middle of Piazza della Repubblica was made in 1888. You can see the sea god Glaucus and two nymphs. Two famous female singers modeled for the nymphs and the statues caused uproar when their voluptuous bodies were revealed. The two singers continued to visit the fountain until their deaths many years later. Many romans remember the two old ladies sitting next to the fountain, remembering how beautiful they once were.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Via Veneto used to be the most glamorous street in Rome. It was the center of the Dolce Vita in the 60s and 70s. Still, a lot of the most expensive and famous hotels and bars are located on this street. It was made famous by filmmaker Federico Fellini, who shot parts of ‘La dolce vita’ here. Thanks to the success of the movie, the street became soon filled with tourists, who made the international movie stars and Roman elites leave.</p>

<p>The American embassy is also located in an enormous palazzo on this street. Queen Margarita, of pizza fame, used to live here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this church, one of the most macabre sights of Rome can be seen. The church is called Santa Maria della Concezione, but the adjacent crypt is better known. It is the Cripta dei Cappuccini. The church was commissioned by Antonio Barberini, twin brother of Pope Urban VIII. The most famous artwork in the church is the painting of Archangel Michael defeating the devil, by Guido Reni. The angel was so beautiful that people thought Guido had gone to heaven to paint the angel, also because the painter had not been seen for quite some time. Guido said: ‘The beauty of the angel you cannot find on earth. I have not seen him and he springs from my fantasy only, but the devil I have seen many times, so I know how he looks.</p>
<p>There is also a copy of a painting by Caravaggio, representing Saint Francis. The original hangs in the room of the prior and cannot be visited.</p>
<p>Next to the church is the macabre crypt. The capuchin monks were moved to this convent by Urban VIII. They agreed, but asked the Pope if they could take their deceased brothers with them. The Pope then gave them earth from Jerusalem for their crypt. The bones of their brothers were then dug up by the light of torches and were taken to this church. The bones were then used to decorate the crypt. The second crypt is filled with bones from soldiers who volunteered to protect the Pope when Italian troops were trying to conquer Rome in the Risorgimento. They died in 1870 and were buried here by the capuchin monks. On the right side you can see the skeleton of Prince Matteo Orsini, who according to his wishes was buried standing up, wearing his habit. In the 5th and last crypt, visitors are reminded that ‘What you are, we were, and what we are, you shall become’.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Piazza Barberini you can see the famous Fontana del Tritone, sculpted by Gian Lorenzo Bernini in 1640. Its brassy color is just a result of a discoloring of the white marble. Triton sits on a shell and blows water from a horn. The shell is carried by a dolphin’s tail.</p>
<figure id="attachment_145" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image071.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-145" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image071.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Palazzo Barberini" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Palazzo Barberini</figcaption></figure>
<p>Around the corner you can find Palazzo Barberini, which was built in 1625 by Carlo Maderno, the architect of the facade of Saint Peter’s. It was built for the Barberini Pope Urban VIII who also commissioned the fountain on the piazza. His coat-of-arm consisted of three bees on a shield. This is why you see this everywhere in this building and also on the fountain. Now the Palazzo houses the Galleria Nazionale D’Arte Antica, which is a very nice museum with some interesting paintings by artists like Caravaggio. It is one of the lesser known museums in Rome, but their collection of paintings is amazing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Trevi Fountain is the most famous fountain of Rome. It was made famous by Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini’s film ‘La Dolce Vita’, in which Anita Ekberg takes a bath in the fountain with Marcello Mastroianni watching. I would advise against jumping in now, as it is continuously watched by policemen who prevent people from reenacting the scene. The best time to visit the fountain is two o’clock in the morning. Then, the tourists are all gone and spotlights illuminate the fountain beautifully. The police are still there though.</p>
<p>The fountain was built halfway through the 18th century. It was paid for with a tax on wine. The story goes that the Pope who instituted this tax couldn’t leave his house without eggs and tomatoes being thrown at him. In the end his investment paid off though. Just look at the number of tourists looking at the fountain (unless you are here at four in the morning). The fountain is located against Palazzo Poli. It was designed by Bernini, but the plan was only executed fifty years after his death by Nicola Salvi. Bernini never saw the fountain. The water comes from the Aqua Virgo, which runs under Via Condotti and ends up here.</p>
<p>The central figure is the god of sea Oceanus. On both sides of Oceanus you can see two Tritons who are taming two horses. One is wild and the other one is quiet. This is a reference to the two shapes the sea can take. The water from the fountain flows from here to many other fountains in the city, like the ones on Piazza Navona.</p>
<p>Maybe you have seen people throwing coins in the fountain. According to legend, if you throw a coin with your right hand over your left shoulder (not the other way around), you will return to Rome. If you throw two coins you will also fall in love with an Italian, but watch out, if you throw three, you will marry one. Every year, about 90.000 euro worth of coins is thrown into the fountain. This money is used to keep the fountain in good shape.</p>
<p>The church in front of the fountain is called the Santi Vicenzi ed Anastasio. In this church the hearts of almost all 17th, 18th and 19th century Popes are being kept. This macabre tradition was discontinued by Pope Pius X in the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
