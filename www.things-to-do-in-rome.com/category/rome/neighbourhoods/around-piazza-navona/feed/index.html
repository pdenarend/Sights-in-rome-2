				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ponte Sisto was built in 1475 during the papacy of Sixtus IV, the same Pope who gave his name to the Sistine Chapel. During the holy year of 1450 the Ponte Sant’Angelo had not been able to accommodate all the pilgrims so a new bridge was made. Now it is a nice pedestrian bridge leading to the Trastevere neighborhood. Trastevere is a good place to find a restaurant or bar. It is beautiful during the day, but really comes to live at night. Friday and Saturday nights the streets are filled with both tourists and Italians.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Close to Campo di Fiore is Piazza Farnese. It is named after the Palazzo Farnese, which now houses the French Embassy. The palazzo was built using stones from the Colosseum. Maybe you noticed when you were looking at the Colosseum that half of the outer ring is missing. This is where the stones ended up. The architect of Palazzo Farnese got a permit to take as many stones as he could from the Colosseum in 24 hours, so he hired as many people as he could and that resulted in a big part of the Colosseum being destroyed. The palace was built for Alessandro Farnese, who became Pope Paul III. He had been made a cardinal when he was very young, because his sister Giulia had become the mistress of Pope Alexander VI. Michelangelo also worked on the palace and inside there are also famous frescos by Annibale Carraci, which you can only sometimes visit.</p>
<p>On the square you can see two fountains. Ancient bathtubs were taken from the baths of Caracalla to be used for the fountains.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This square is called Campo de’ Fiori, the field of flowers. Until 1431 this was a field where flowers grew. It was also the place where public executions were held. The names of the small streets surrounding Campo still refer to this. Vicolo de Venti refers to the 20 (venti) heretics that were thrown in hot oil here. Via della Corda means Street of the Rope which refers to the Gallows.</p>
<figure id="attachment_96" style="width: 200px;" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image022.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-96" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image022.jpg?resize=200%2C300" alt="Campo de' Fiori" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Campo de&#8217; Fiori</figcaption></figure>
<p>The statue in the middle of the Square represents Giordano Bruno, a philosopher and Dominican monk who was put to death by the Catholic Church for his beliefs. He claimed the earth was not the center of the universe and that stars are suns that are spread out throughout the galaxy. The statue was put here in 1887, when the Popes had stopped ruling all of Rome. In the medallions we see portraits of eight other heretics that had to die for their beliefs.</p>
<p>Vanozza Catanei used to run a few inns on campo. She was the lover of Rodrigo Borgia who became Pope Alexander VI. She had four children by the Pope, of which Lucrezia and Cesare Borgia are the most famous.</p>
<p>Campo is one of the centers of Roman nightlife. During the day this is a market, but in the evening the square is filled with a mix of young Italians and tourists who hang outside or in the bars. It is very nice to spend an evening here. It is more authentic than Piazza Navona, which is touristy and expensive.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santa Maria dell’Anima is the German church. You can find it just behind Piazza Navona. Around this church the German pilgrims used to stay when they came to Rome. In the church is also the grave of the last non-Italian Pope before John Paul II. He was Hadrian VI and he was Dutch. He was made Pope because of the influence of his employer and student, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. His pontificate was not a success. He was way too strict for the Romans to handle. They were used to Popes like Alexander VI and Julius II, who had children and were more like renaissance princes. Everybody was very relieved when Hadrian died very soon. Signs of gratitude were put at the door of the Popes physician, who had not been able (or wanting) to save him.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next to the Sant&#8217;Agnese church is Palazzo Pamphili, which now is the Brazilian embassy, but used to be the home of the powerful Pamphili family, the family of Pope Innocentius X. Nowadays this Pope is most famous for the portrait the Spanish artist Diego Velazquez did of him. This painting can be found in the museum Galleria Doria Pamphili, on Via del Corso. Francis Bacon was inspired by this painting for his series of paintings of Screaming Popes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fountain in the middle is the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, designed and executed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. It is considered to be one of his masterpieces. Pope Innocent X did not like Bernini, because he had been very close with his predecessor, Urban VIII. Therefore, Innocent did not give Bernini any commissions. Bernini was very clever though and participated anonymously in the contest to design the fountain. Of course his design was a lot better than his competitors and Innocent was forced to hire Bernini. He said ‘the only way to avoid employing Bernini is not see his designs’. The fountain is from 1651 and its message is very typical of the time. It represents the Catholic Message which is diffused over the world. You can see four river gods sitting on rocks. They represent the four continents (the fifth was not yet discovered).</p>
<p><span id="more-366"></span></p>
<p>One river god represents the Nile in Africa. His face is covered by a piece of cloth, because at that time it was unknown where the Nile started. According to legend this figure holds his hand in front of the church that stands on that side of the Piazza; this is because Bernini disliked the architect of the church, his rival Borromini. The Ganges has a laurel wreath around his head and a peddle between the knees, because the Ganges is navigable. The Donau represents Europe and is recognizable by the Papal coat of arms. The river god representing the Rio de la Plata is recognizable by the coins at his feet, which represent the mineral riches of the Americas.</p>
<p>The Obelisk on top of the fountain is not from Egypt but was carved by the Romans.</p>
<p>Bernini really disliked this fountain. He thought he made it really badly. Every time he passed it in his carriage he would close the curtains, so he would not see it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Piazza Navona is one of the most famous piazzas in Rome. In the time of the Roman republic not much was here. It was the Campus Martius, the field of Mars. It was used as training field for the legions and sport events were held here. During the empire this area was also used. The piazza you stand on now once was the Stadium of Domitian. It was a racetrack. If you look at the shape of the piazza you can clearly still see the shape of the old stadium. The name also comes from the stadium. Agones means games in Latin. Agones changed into Navona. 30000 people were able to watch athletic games in this stadium.</p>
<p>Piazza Navona got its current shape in the 17th century under Pope Innocent X of the Pamphili family. He wanted this square to be the most beautiful in Europe. Every August he would close the drains of the fountains and a small lake would be formed. It was 60 cm deep. Only in 1867 this tradition was discontinued and the square was paved. During Christmas, a nice Christmas Market is being held here and during normal times, artists sell paintings here. Be careful when buying though, it is said some come straight out of a computer printer.</p>
<p>There are many bars and restaurants on this square, but they tend to be too expensive for what they offer. In my view they only cater to tourists, most Romans never eat or drink here. When Romans want to drink a glass of wine on a Piazza they go to Campo de’ Fiori, very close to here. Another good option if you are looking for a more authentic restaurant experience is to walk into the street that is next to the Santa Agnese church on the Piazza. In the little streets behind this church you can find many nice restaurants and trattoria’s that are a lot better than what you find on Piazza Navona.</p>

It was built between 1889 and 1910 by Guglielmo Caldernini. His creation never managed to convince the Romans who have always found this imposing building very ugly. Piazza Cavour, the square that faces the Palazzaccio is a nice place to sit down for a while.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ponte Sant’Angelo is the old bridge that connects the Vatican with the city Centre. It was built in 136 AD in the time of Emperor Hadrian. The three arches in the middle are the original ones from antiquity. On the bridge you can see 10 statues of angels. They were made by the workshop of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the amazing baroque sculptor. Bernini made two angels himself, but the Pope considered them too beautiful to be put outside. All the designs are Bernini’s although his students executed the work. They all hold objects from the story of the passion of Christ. You can see their robes wave in the wind. This is because Bernini knew they would stand outside in the wind. Before, this was the only bridge to the Vatican and all the pilgrims had to cross this bridge. Now a new bridge is standing next to it on which cars can pass the river.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Castel Sant’Angelo is a very strange building. Once it was the mausoleum for Emperor Hadrian. It was built in 135 AD. Later, Emperors Marcus Aurelius, Septimus Severus and Caracalla were also buried here.</p>
<p>In the middle ages it was transformed into a fortress, to protect the Vatican. It is called the fortress of angels because Pope Gregory the Great saw an angel appear above the building in 590. At that time Rome was suffering from an epidemic of plague. The Pope held 40 processions to stop the plague and at the end he saw Archangel Michael appear above the castle, who put his sword back in its holder. Everybody understood this meant the plague was over and the next day it was. Ever since the building is called Castel Sant’Angelo and a statue of Archangel Michael putting his sword in his holder stands on top of the building. The current statue dates from the 18th century.</p>
<p>The fortress is 5 stories high. Originally it must have looked quite different. Trees grew around a big statue of Hadrian in his chariot. Because the mausoleum was built on a very strategic spot, close to the only bridge to the Vatican, it was transformed in a fortress. It has been a papal residence and prison and five Popes were executed inside. Now it is a museum. From the top of the building you have a very beautiful view of Rome.</p>
