				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santa Maria della Vittoria is a very small church. Its fame derives from the statue which can be found inside. It is one of Bernini’s masterpieces, Teresa in Ecstasy. The church used to be a convent of the Carmelites. This order was reformed by Saint Teresa of Ávila. Teresa is one of three female doctors of the Church. She died in the night of the 4th to the 15th of October 1582. Incidentally, this was the night when a few days were skipped because of the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. She was canonized in 1622 and a few decades later Bernini designed the Cornaro chapel in this church to honor her.</p>
<p><span id="more-520"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_181" style="width: 225px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image106.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-181" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image106.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="Santa Teresa by Bernini" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Santa Teresa by Bernini</figcaption></figure>
<p>Bernini designed the chapel like a theatre. You can even see spectators in the tribunes. These are Cardinal Federico Cornaro and his ancestors. Of course the main statue is the one of Teresa in ecstasy. It is made from one piece of marble. Teresa described this scene in one of her books like this.</p>
<p>‘I saw an angel close by me, on my left side, in bodily form. This I am not accustomed to see, unless very rarely. Though I have visions of angels frequently, yet I see them only by an intellectual vision, such as I have spoken of before. It was our Lord&#8217;s will that in this vision I should see the angel in this way. He was not large, but small of stature, and most beautiful — his face burning, as if he were one of the highest angels, who seem to be all of fire: they must be those whom we call cherubim. Their names they never tell me; but I see very well that there is in heaven so great a difference between one angel and another, and between these and the others, that I cannot explain it.</p>
<p>I saw in his hand a long spear of gold, and at the iron&#8217;s point there seemed to be a little fire. He appeared to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it. The soul is satisfied now with nothing less than God. The pain is not bodily, but spiritual; though the body has its share in it, even a large one. It is a caressing of love so sweet which now takes place between the soul and God, that I pray God of His goodness to make him experience it who may think that I am lying.’</p>
<p>Bernini followed closely the description of the Saint, even in the slight erotic overtones of the description of her ecstasy. Teresa seems to float in the air and her face is looking ecstatic indeed. Because of the slight erotic feeling of the statue, some people have argued to remove it from the Church or even destroy it. French author Charles de Brosses wrote in the 18th century: ‘If this is heavenly love, then I know it very well’. Bernini himself considered this his masterpiece.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri is a church, built inside the ruins of the Baths of Diocletian. These baths were built in 305 AD and could hold 3000 people. The small middle part was transformed by Michelangelo into a church. If you have the chance, go inside, because it is amazing. You can see the simple doors and facade on one side of the square. Michelangelo decided against the building of a facade. He wanted to leave the ruins as they are. But when you go inside you can see how big the building is.</p>
<p><span id="more-516"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_178" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image104.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-178" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image104.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="Inside Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri " data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Inside Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri</figcaption></figure>
<p>Inside, you also can see that the shape of the church is unusual. It is not shaped like a Latin cross. This is of course because the building was destined to be a bathing complex. The church is called Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri, Saint Mary of the angels and martyrs. Inside the church you can see a long line on the floor. This was used to calculate the time of year. A hole in the ceiling would let a beam of sunlight in and on midday a ray of light would show the time of year on the line. This was used to calculate Easter.</p>
<p>On the right side of the church is the Museo Nazionale Romano. It was opened in 1899 in another part of the baths and it houses a collection of ancient statues. The museum now is very big with buildings all across town. You can buy one ticket and visit all of them throughout the city. If you are interested in Roman art, it is most definitely worth a visit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The main station in Rome is called Termini. This has nothing to do with the English word terminal. It is Latin for ‘at the bathhouses’, the Terme. Diocletian’s bathhouses were (and still are) very close to here. On this spot a small station was built in 1873, but it was too small, so Mussolini decided a new, imposing station should be built in 1937. The building as we see it now was opened only in 1950. The building’s purpose was to show off the greatness of Fascist Italy. If you look at the sides of the building you can see the design was partly taken from the Colosseum. This is typical fascist style. It is very simple, going back to classical shapes without too many ornaments.</p>
<p><span id="more-514"></span></p>
<p>The piazza in front of Termini is called Piazza dei 500. It is named after the 500 soldiers that died in 1887, fighting in Ethiopia. On the northern side of the piazza you can still see a piece of the old city walls standing. This wall was built in the 4th century BC after the Gauls invaded.</p>
<p>The wall of Servius Tullius has almost completely disappeared, but a small part can be seen on piazza cinquecento next to the Termini train station. Traditionally sinners were buried here, because people believed this was the spot Nero was buried after he killed himself. Prostitutes were for example buried here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This church is called Santa Maria Prassede, and although it is not well known, it is one of the oldest and most beautiful churches of Rome. The church is dedicated Praxedes, the daughter of a Roman senator, Pudens. Peter stayed in his house for some time and converted him to Christianity, together with her daughters Praxedes and Pudentiana. Praxedes dedicated her life to helping the poor and persecuted. She hid Christians in her house to protect them from Roman persecutions. When the Romans found out where their hiding place was they killed all 23 of them. Praxedes then used a sponge to collect their blood, which she kept in the well of her house. The Church is built on the location of her house.</p>
<p><span id="more-512"></span></p>
<p>In the central nave there is a porphyry disc which covers the old well where the blood and bodies of the martyrs are kept.</p>
<h2>Mosaics of Santa Prassede</h2>
<figure id="attachment_297" style="width: 602px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image217.jpg"><img class="wp-image-297 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image217.jpg?resize=602%2C283" alt="Arch Mosaic of Santa Prassede" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Arch Mosaic of Santa Prassede</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the arch closer to the nave you can see a heavenly Jerusalem depicted. You can see city walls and towers, which alludes to the Book of Revelation. Christ can be seen inside the city in the middle, wearing a red tunic. He is surrounded by Saints, like Mary, John the Baptist and of course Santa Prassede, Praxedes. Outside the gates of the city saved souls are waiting to enter.</p>
<p>In the crypt below the altar you can find the graves of Praxedes and Pudentiana.</p>
<figure id="attachment_298" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image218.jpg"><img class="wp-image-298 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image218.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="Apse Mosaic of Santa Prassede" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Apse Mosaic of Santa Prassede</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Church is most famous for its 9th century Byzantine mosaics, the only of their kind in Rome.  In the apse we see Christ with his right arm lifted up. He is wearing a tunic and sandals. He shows the palm of his hand with the sign of the crucifixion. The hand of god comes from the sky above him and carries a golden crown or wreath to put on Christ’s head. On the right of Christ you can see Peter with his hands around Pudentiana and on the left you can see Paul with his hands around Praxedes. They introduce both ladies to Christ. The hands of both women are covered, because it was customary to cover your hands when you presented gifts to the Emperor at that time. The two palm trees on both sides represent Paradise. Below the figures flows the river Jordan.</p>
<p>Above Christ we see the Lamb of God on a throne inside a blue medallion. The lamb represents the resurrected Christ. On both sides of the medallion we see seven candles, three on the left and four on the right. They represent the seven churches from Asia. Next to the candles on both sides we see angels, evangelists and 24 elders with white robes and crowns. They symbolize wisdom. You can recognize the evangelists by their symbols. John is the eagle, Luke the bull, the angel is Matthew and Mark the lion.</p>
<p>Below Christ we see the Lamb of God with the four rivers of Paradise, which flow until the end of the world. On the left you can see lambs coming out of Bethlehem, which represents the church of the pagans and on the right from Jerusalem, which represents the church of the Jews.</p>
<figure id="attachment_299" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image219.jpg"><img class="wp-image-299 size-full" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image219.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="Chapel of Bishop Zeno" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Chapel of Bishop Zeno</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can find some more amazing mosaics in the small chapel of bishop Zeno. These are the most beautiful Byzantine mosaics in Rome. You can see a lot of figures depicted. Many are Saints, like Mary, Zeno, the apostles, Agnes, Peter Jacob etc.</p>
<p>On the roof you can see a depiction of Christ as pantocrator, which is Greek for ruler of all things. Next to the window Saints Agnes, Pudentia and Praxedes are in procession towards the altar. You can also see a lamb on a mountain and deer who drink from four rivers of Paradise, which is a reference to baptizing. Above the altar is a picture of the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist at the feet of Christ.</p>
<figure id="attachment_300" style="width: 379px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image220.jpg"><img class="wp-image-300 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image220.jpg?resize=379%2C538" alt="First work of Bernini" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">First work of Bernini</figcaption></figure>
<p>Across the nave from the chapel of Zeno you can also see the first work of Bernini. It is the grave of the majordomo of the Pope, Santoni. Bernini made this when he was 15.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santa Maria Maggiore is one of the four papal basilicas of Rome and is also Vatican territory. It was built on the top of Esquiline hill, because of a dream of a Pope. In his dream, Pope Liberius was visited by an angel, who told him to build a church on top of the hill where snow would fall the next day. Of course, it was the middle of August, and snow does not normally fall at that time of the year. But the Pope woke up and saw that snow had fallen on top of Esquiline hill. He went over and discovered that the owner of the land had had the same dream. They then decided to build the church. This was in the 4th century. Every august this event is remembered by throwing white flowers in the air on August the 5th. The campanile, the bell tower, is a Romanesque structure from the 14th century. The facade is both baroque and medieval. If you stand in front of the Church, you can see that a newer, baroque facade is built around the older one. You can still see the medieval mosaic on what used to be the facade.</p>
<p>On the square in front of the church stands a Corinthian column, which came from Constantine&#8217;s Basilica on the Forum. On top, a bronze statue of Mary was put in 1614.</p>
<p><span id="more-510"></span></p>
<p>The facade was built in 1744, but through it you can still see the mosaic from the 1300s on the original facade. The mosaic tells the story of the dream and the snow. You can see Maria, Pope Liberius and the owner of the land on which the snow fell. On the right you can see the Pope drawing the design of the church in the snow. Unfortunately, it is very hard to see the mosaics well from down on the piazza.</p>
<p>The campanile is the highest in Rome. It is 75 meters high. Every day at half past nine the bells ring to help lost travelers with their orientation.</p>
<h2>Entrance of Santa Maria Maggiore</h2>
<p>In the entrance hall you can see on your right a statue of Philip IV of Spain, who awarded the church a yearly contribution. Ever since, Spanish kings give money to this church. On the right you can see the Porta Sancta, the holy door that is only opened in a Holy year by the Pope himself.</p>
<h2>The Interior of Santa Maria Maggiore</h2>
<figure id="attachment_311" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image230.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-311" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image230.jpg?resize=600%2C497" alt="The Interior of Santa Maria Maggiore" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Interior of Santa Maria Maggiore</figcaption></figure>
<p>The interior consists of a monumental mix of styles. The beautiful floor is a Cosmatesque work. The Cosmati were a family who were renowned in this area for their way of making beautiful floors. They use pieces of stone and glass to create geometric mosaics on church floors</p>
<p>The columns are still the original ones from the 5th century church. Also have a look at the renaissance ceiling. It is one of the most beautiful ceilings in Rome and is decorated with the first gold that was brought from America by Columbus. It was a gift from King Ferdinand of Aragon</p>
<p>Above the nave you can see 28 small mosaics from the 5th century with biblical stories.</p>
<h2>Crypt of the Nativity</h2>
<figure id="attachment_312" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image231.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-312" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image231.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="Crypt of the Nativity" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Crypt of the Nativity</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the area under the high altar a very important relic is being kept in the Crypt of the Nativity. It is the Holy Manger in which Christ was laid down after he was born. You can see the old pieces of wood in a silver and glass urn. Pope Theodor I took it from Bethlehem to Rome in the 7th century. The pieces of the manger are taken in procession through the church, every year on Christmas eve. The statue of the praying Pope represents Pope Pius IX from the 19th century. This crypt is also the burial place of Saint Jerome, one of the Doctors of the Church, who translated the bible in Latin in the 4th century.</p>
<h2>Apse Mosaic</h2>
<p>In the mosaic on the arch above the altar you can see four stories from the life of Mary: the annunciation, the adoration of the Magi, the Presentation of Mary  and the Flight to Egypt. The apse mosaic is from 1295 and made by Franciscan friar Jacopo Torriti, who dated and signed it. The main theme is the Triumph of Mary. Mary sits next to Christ as his equal in heaven. The Franciscans claimed for a very long time that Mary, after her death, ascended immediately to heaven. This dogma was only made official by Pope Pius IX in 1854.</p>
<h2>The Borghese Chapel</h2>
<p>The Borghese Chapel is located on the far left. It was built in 1611 and named after Pope Paul V of the Borghese family. Pauline Bonaparte, Napoleon’s sister, is buried here in the Borghese Crypt, but you cannot see her grave. The painting of the Madonna with child above the altar would have been painted by Saint Luke himself and finished by angels. The painting was already used in processions through Rome in 590 by Pope Gregory the Great to stop an epidemic of the pest.</p>

<p>In the Santa Maria Maggiore there is also a Sistine Chapel. It is the last big chapel on the right. It was named after Pope Sixtus V, and not after Sixtus IV who commissioned the other, more famous Sistine Chapel at the Vatican. It was built in the 16th century by Domenico Fontana. You can see a tabernacle from the 16th century here which is supported by four bronze angels. There are also some Papal graves here. On the left and right Pius V and Sixtus V are buried. Sixtus V was a very tough Pope. On the bas relief on his grave you see a depiction of the heads of highwaymen that are brought into the city after a Papal campaign against them. On one day he could hang 60 of them, while he was watching and having dinner.</p>
<p>Just outside the Sistine chapel is the humble grave of Gian Lorenzo Bernini.</p>
<h2>The baptistery</h2>
<p>The baptistery is located in the front of the church on the right side. Against the left wall of the chapel you can see a bust of a black man. It is the grave of Antonio Emanuele Funta, who was an ambassador from the Kingdom of the Congo, who was sent to Rome in 1604. His trip took two years and a year after he arrived he died.</p>
<h2>Chapel of Santi Michele e Pietro in Vincoli</h2>
<p>From here you can access a souvenir shop on the left in the Chapel of Santi Michele e Pietro in Vincoli. The floors in this chapel are especially noteworthy. It is a brilliant example of Cosmatesque work. None of the patterns on the floor is the same. This is to express the uniqueness of God.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Piazza della Repubblica was once part of the huge baths of Diocletian. The half circular shape of the piazza still reflects this. This part used to be the entrance hall to the baths. Parts of the actual baths are still standing on one side of the piazza. Bathing was very important for the ancient Romans and was an important part of everybody’s life. Everybody went to the baths. Men, women, slaves and masters, poor people and very rich. Of course everybody had different hours on which they were allowed to go to the baths. Personal hygiene was very important. The Romans believed in the idea of a healthy mind in a healthy body. Rome had a lot of very imposing baths, because all of the one million people that lived in ancient Rome went to bathe. It was also a place to do business meetings or to meet up with friends. Besides bathing, you could also get a massage, go to the gym or have a relaxing walk in the gardens. Of course, also stories are known of theft, murder and orgies that took place in the baths. In Pompeii archeologists found this inscription: ‘Bathing, wine and sex wreck our body, but what is life without bathing, wine and sex’.</p>

<p>The fountain in the middle of Piazza della Repubblica was made in 1888. You can see the sea god Glaucus and two nymphs. Two famous female singers modeled for the nymphs and the statues caused uproar when their voluptuous bodies were revealed. The two singers continued to visit the fountain until their deaths many years later. Many romans remember the two old ladies sitting next to the fountain, remembering how beautiful they once were.</p>
