				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trastevere used to be a popular neighborhood, where typical roman families used to live. This aspect of the neighborhood has disappeared a little. Now many tourists, but also Romans from all over the city come here to have dinner or to drink. It is a fun area and very beautiful. Once, in Roman times, this area was populated by slaves, seamen, Syrians and Jews and lay outside the city walls. This was the place where foreign traders lived. The name means across the Tevere, which is the Italian name for the Tiber. In the picture you can see the Piazza of Santa Maria in Trastevere, the social center of the neighborhood.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The church on the island is dedicated to St. Bartholomew, one of the apostles of Jesus. It was built around the year 1000 and a few centuries later the remains of the apostle Bartholomew were brought to the church, after which it was dedicated to him. His remains are buried below the main altar and the plate on which the remains were brought here can be seen on the right next to the altar. Michelangelo painted Bartholomew in his fresco of the last judgment in the Sistine Chapel. He is the one holding his own skin in his hand, because he was skinned alive.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Between Trastevere and the ghetto lies the Tiber Island, the isola Tiberina. In Roman times, the Temple of Asclepius was here. He was the god of medicine and so talented he could raise people from the dead. His daughters were called Hygieia and Panacea. If you were sick you would go to the temple of Asclepius. You would sleep there, and if you saw a snake in your dream you would have been healed.</p>
<p>Later a hospital for people suffering from the plague was here. This way the patients could be put in quarantine. Even nowadays there is a hospital on the island. It a tradition that is older than 2000 years. Quite amazing!</p>
<p>According to legend, the island was created when the Romans threw the grain supply of the last King of Rome, Tarquinius Superbus, in the river when they deposed him and founded the republic. Earth was thrown on top of the grain and the many seeds created the island. In reality the island is of volcanic origin.</p>
<figure id="attachment_141" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image067.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-141" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image067.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Ponte Rotto" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ponte Rotto</figcaption></figure>
<p>To the south of the island stands the Ponte Rotto, the broken bridge. It was built in 142 BC and it was the first stone bridge that crossed the Tiber. It was also the first arched bridge in the world. It was destroyed by a flood somewhere in the 16th century but the middle part still stands in the water.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The area between Capitoline Hill and the river used to be the Jewish Ghetto. From the 2nd century onward Jewish people lived in Rome. They used to live across the river in Trastevere. There were 13 synagogues in ancient Rome and they were allowed to exercise their faith freely. This situation changed radically in the middle ages. Jewish men had to wear a yellow hat and women a yellow ribbon. Many more Jews came to Rome after their expulsion from the Kingdom of Spain in 1492. Then, on the 26th of July by order of Pope Paul IV the Jews were locked up in a Ghetto. They were not allowed to leave at night and the ghetto could be closed off by big gates. They were just allowed to trade in second hand clothing, wool, furs and iron scraps. The Jews were only freed from the Ghetto in 1798 when the troops of Napoleon conquered Rome and abducted the Pope to Paris. The walls were only torn down in 1870.</p>
<p>Some inhabitants of the Ghetto were deported in the Second World War. On 16 October 1943, the SS went around the area around the Porticus of Octavia and captured about 1000 Jewish people. They were deported to Auschwitz. Only 17 managed to survive. There is a sign about this on the piazza in front of the Porticus of Octavia, which is called Largo 16 ottobre 1943.</p>
<figure id="attachment_135" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image061.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-135" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image061.jpg?resize=300%2C214" alt="Porticus of Octavia" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Porticus of Octavia</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the main street of the Ghetto stands this Roman doorway. It is called the Porticus of Octavia. It was a big square, surrounded by 300 columns. There also was a library here. Now, just the entrance gate is left. This also was built by Emperor August, in honor of his sister Octavia, the mother of Marcellus. Of Emperor Augustus it was said that he found Rome in brick and left her in marble. Augustus ruled for a very long time. It was a prosperous and peaceful time for the empire. His reign is sometimes called the Pax Augusta, the peace of Augustus.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image062.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-136" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image062.jpg?resize=300%2C167" alt="Theatre of Marcellus" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Theatre of Marcellus</figcaption></figure>
<p>This very odd looking building once was the Theatre of Marcellus. You can clearly see that in Roman times it was a Theatre, but then in the middle ages a powerful aristocratic family, the Orsini, made it into a fort and palace.</p>
<p>Emperor Augustus built the theatre for his nephew Marcellus, who was supposed to succeed him. Unfortunately, Marcellus died at a very young age.</p>
<p>20.000 people could be seated here. It is older than the Colosseum. At the opening of the theatre, some parts of the seating collapsed and people wanted to leave, but Augustus himself sat down at the most dangerous spot to keep people from leaving. This was a real theatre and not an arena, so no gladiator fights where held here, but still, in some plays one actor would really die. Convicted criminals were used for this. Next to the theatre are some remains of a very old temple of Apollo.</p>
<figure id="attachment_137" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image063.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-137" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image063.jpg?resize=300%2C218" alt="The Synagogue" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Synagogue</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Synagogue was built in 1904. The building of the synagogue was meant to show the Jews that the new Italian state would do a better job in looking out for them than the Papacy ever did. The synagogue has a big dome, a challenge to Saint Peter’s. The Pope became very angry and laid a ban on the new Italian state.</p>
<p>Now about 15.000 Jews live in Rome. Most of them live outside the ghetto these days.</p>
<p>Pope John Paul II was the first Pope to visit the synagogue in 1986. It was also visited later by Pope Benedict XVI.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This hill is one of the seven on which Rome was originally built. It is called Capitoline hill and is the smallest of the seven. The buildings you see when you stand on piazza Campidoglio were built in the renaissance, but in Roman times this hill was one of the most important places in Rome, together with Palatine hill across the forum, where the Emperors lived. On Capitoline hill the most important temple of the Roman Empire stood. It was the enormous Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, with golden roof. The foundations of the temple can still be seen inside the Capitoline Museums. Just looking at the foundations will make you realize how big the temple really was. Besides the Temple there were also smaller sanctuaries and altars. On the south side of the hill was a steep cliff from which traitors were thrown to their deaths. On the spot where now the Spartan church Santa Maria in Aracoeli stands, the temple of Juno Moneta once stood. In this temple the Roman mint was located. All the Roman coins were produced here and the English word Mint and money comes from the name of this temple: Juno Moneta.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Roman Empire, this area was left to fall apart. The temples were torn down to build new buildings and it became an insignificant hill until the renaissance, when Pope Paul III commissioned Michelangelo to redesign the hill. His design is very beautiful as you can see when you stand on Piazza del Campidoglio on top of the hill. He completely changed the focus of the hill. He made a big staircase, the cordonata, on what used to be the backside of the hill. This is because the center of Rome had changed from the Forum to the area around Piazza Navona. He designed the piazza using a strictly symmetrical floor plan.</p>
<p>Around the square you can see three public buildings. On the east side, built on top of the remains of the Tabularium, the archives of ancient Rome, stands the Palazzo Senatorio, which nowadays is the City Hall of Rome. In the middle, below the terrace, he put an antique statue, which represents Rome, which is flanked by two statues of River Gods, the Nile and the Tiber. If you come here on Sunday, you often see people getting married.</p>
<figure id="attachment_131" style="width: 274px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image057.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-131" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image057.jpg?resize=274%2C300" alt="The Concordata" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Concordata</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Concordata is the access road to the square. It has very low steps, in order to allow horses to ascend as well. At the bottom of the stairs you can see two lions, who were found in the Campus Martius, but who are from Egypt. At the top of the Concordata you can see two statues on both sides holding horses. They wear strange hats. This is because they are Castor and Pollux, sons of Leda and Jupiter. Jupiter disguised himself as a swan when he seduced Leda, so Castor and Pollux were born out of two eggs. This is why they wear an eggshell on their heads. When one of them died, Jupiter made both of them immortal and put them in the sky as the sign Gemini.</p>
<p>Halfway down the stairs you can see the small statue of Cola di Rienzo, who was a Medieval populist who wanted to restore the grandeur of ancient Rome. Until 1960 there were two cages here, one with a live wolf and one with an eagle, the two symbols of Rome. Animal rights activists managed to convince the city to stop this tradition.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image058.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-132" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image058.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="Capitoline Museums" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Capitoline Museums</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the south side lies Palazzo dei Conservatori and on the north side Palazzo Nuovo. The Palazzo dei Conservatori already existed, but Michelangelo gave it a new renaissance facade, which is identical to the one of Palazzo Nuovo on the other side of the square. These two palaces harbor the Capitoline Museums. They are connected to each other under the earth by a tunnel which leads through the old Roman Tabularium, under the City Hall. It was the first publicly accessible museum in the world. Clement XII opened it in 1734 for the general public.</p>
<p>If you have the time, go visit the museums. The museums have a mixed collection. You see many world famous roman statues, like the original equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius. Also, you can see the archeological excavations of the foundations of the temple of Jupiter. I sometimes go there with tour groups if it rains. It makes for a nice excursion, especially if the weather outside is not the best.</p>
<figure id="attachment_133" style="width: 225px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image059.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-133" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image059.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="Marcus Aurelius" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Marcus Aurelius</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the middle of the square stands the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius. It is a copy of an original which now stands inside the Capitoline Museums. The original was put here by Michelangelo and stood here for many centuries, until it was moved to protect it. The original is also made of bronze and it is just luck that it still exists. Many bronze statues were melted down, but people thought this statue represented Emperor Constantine, the first Christian Emperor, so it was saved. Later it turned out to represent Marcus Aurelius.</p>
<p>The base of the statue is the only sculpture by Michelangelo that is still standing outside. Now, if you take an Italian fifty euro cent coin, you will see this statue, together with the design on the floor. These geometrical shapes were also designed by Michelangelo, but only recently executed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Piazza Venezia is the heart of Rome. It is named after the Palazzo that stands next to it, which was built in 1455 by a cardinal, Pietro Barbo, from Venice. He later became Pope Paul II. Most of its fame derives from the fact that Mussolini had his offices here and often held speeches from the balcony. He always kept the lights on, even when he was not there, to show he was working hard for the Italian people.</p>

<p>Of course the most impressive building here is the Monument for Victor Emanuel II, the first king of Italy. Italy only exists as a country since 1870, before this the peninsula was divided into a lot of small states. When Italy became united it was felt that an appropriate monument should be erected. This monument was meant as a counterpart to Saint Peter’s. The Italians felt that their capital should not only have an enormous monument to the church, but also a monument to their new fatherland. Unfortunately, the design did not please the Romans. They call it the wedding cake or the typewriter. The monument was finished in 1911 and since 1921 the grave of the Unknown Soldier is also here. The fountain to the left represents the Tyrrhenian Sea and the one on the right the Adriatic Sea. On the top are the triumphal chariots of unity and freedom, and of course, in the middle, you can see Victor Emanuel on his horse.</p>
<p>You can go up the stairs and in the building is a free museum about the Risorgimento, the unification of Italy. On the back of the building you can find an elevator. If you pay the ticket it will take you to the top of the building where you have an amazing view of the city.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Largo Torre Argentina you can see a theatre. It is the most important theatre of Rome. Rossini premiered his Barbiere di Seviglia here. It was a complete disaster. Fans of another composer came to heckle Rossini, who at one point turned around and applauded the spectators. He then had to flee the theatre. The next day the show went according to plan and the Barbiere di Sevigla has been a classic ever since.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This area is called Largo di Torre Argentina. Here you can see the remains of four temples from republican times. They were found in 1926. We don’t know to which gods they were dedicated, so we call the temples A, B, C and D. The temples were excavated in the time of Mussolini. Some people even accused him of just putting some rubble together just to show he had found another remnant of ancient Rome.</p>
<p>Maybe you have seen the many cats strolling around the temples. This is because on one side there is a cat sanctuary. Abandoned cats are being taken care of. You can even go downstairs and have a look around, but watch out, it really smells of cats. The volunteers sell some fun souvenirs as well.</p>
<p>Somewhere around the square the murder of Julius Caesar took place. The senate held meetings here while the senate building on the forum was being restored. In 44 BC Caesar was murdered by his fellow senators, who felt his reforms deprived them of power. More than 60 men conspired against him and he was stabbed to death by 23 stabs as he put his toga over his head.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The San Luigi dei Francesi is the national church of France in Rome. It was designed by Giacomo della Porta and executed by Domenico Fontana between 1518 and 1589. The facade has several statues with famous people from the history of France, like Charlemagne, Saint Louis, Saint Clothilde and Saint Jeanne of Valois.</p>
<p>Inside is one of the masterpieces of Domenichino, a famous baroque painter. On the ceiling he painted the histories of Saint Cecilia. Domenichino was for a period considered one of the best painters of all time, but his fame is somewhat diminished now.</p>
<p><span id="more-437"></span></p>
<p>The church is most famous though for the three canvases painted by Caravaggio in the Contarelli Chapel. You can find these on in the chapel on the far left side.</p>

<p>They are ‘The calling of Saint Matthew’, one of Caravaggio’s absolute masterpieces, ‘The inspiration of Saint Matthew’ and ‘The martyrdom of Saint Matthew’. Caravaggio’s real name was Michelangelo Merisi, but he came from the town of Caravaggio, which explains his nickname. He was a very original painter. He was amazing in the depiction of light and dark. His subjects all look like contemporary people and he often used people he met in bars to pose for him. They always look poor and often have dirty nails. Caravaggio believed that Jesus and his apostles were also just normal people and not rich, so he painted them like that. This was often misunderstood in Caravaggio’s time. Caravaggio did not get along with his patrons and was often found in the pubs around town. Once, during a brawl, he killed someone and had to flee Rome, never to return.</p>
<p>Look at the calling of Saint Matthew, it is a true masterpiece. Jesus is in the dark, on the right side and points to Matthew who looks up from his game surprised and points at himself, like he is saying ‘Me?’ See how the light emanates from Jesus and falls on Matthews face.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you pass by the Sant’Ignazio, you should definitely go in, even if it is just for a second. But before you do so, have a look at the Piazza Sant’Ignazio in front of it. It is a very nice example of baroque architecture. Look at how playful the buildings are built. This is not a geometric design of the renaissance anymore. Everything is rounded. Then, when you go inside, you will be amazed by the ceiling of the church.</p>
<figure id="attachment_118" style="width: 417px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image044.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-118" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image044.jpg?resize=417%2C268" alt="Ceiling of Sant'Ignazio" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ceiling of Sant&#8217;Ignazio</figcaption></figure>
<p>It is an amazing example of perspective painting. If you stand on the marker in the middle of the nave of the church and look up, the perspective in the ceiling fresco is exactly right and the ceiling looks much higher than it actually is. But if you move to other parts of the church, the illusion is broken. You can try it by walking all the way to the altar and look back to the ceiling of the nave. It is an amazing fresco and it was painted by a Jesuit monk, called Andrea Pozzo, who was also a mathematician. In it, he depicts the triumph of Saint Ignatius, the founder of the Jesuit order. Right in the middle of the fresco you can see Jesus, hanging on to his cross. From Jesus, a ray of light shoots towards Ignatius, who is sitting on a cloud. The light is then reflected by Ignatius and illuminates the four continents. These continents are reflected by the four pillars in the corners of the fresco. Their names are written on the pillars as well: Africa, Europe, Asia and America. Australia had not yet been discovered. The continents are also recognizable by symbols. A Native American can be seen around the American pillar and a black queen around the African.</p>
<figure id="attachment_119" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image045.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-119" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image045.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Dome of Sant'Ignazio" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dome of Sant&#8217;Ignazio</figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there is also the dome. The dome is not real, but also painted. The monks of the adjacent monastery did not want the big dome blocking the light in their library, so they asked the Jesuits to not build a dome. They did not build a dome, but instead asked Andrea Pozzo to paint one. It is a gigantic trompe-l&#8217;oeil.</p>
<p>The church itself is a typical example of Roman baroque style. It is, of course, a Jesuit church and the baroque was a style the Jesuits often liked to use in their buildings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This church, adjacent to the Pantheon, is the only Gothic church in Rome. It is called Santa Maria Sopra Minerva. Sopra means above, so the church was built on top of a temple dedicated to Minerva. Churches were often built on top of temples. After Christianity replaced paganism, the temples were no longer needed and were considered blasphemous. So they were torn down and with the building material recovered churches were built.</p>
<p>The facade is simple and dates from the renaissance, but the interior of the church is gothic. The gothic style was never very popular in Italy and at the time of the style’s popularity the Popes lived in Avignon in France, so not much was built in Rome at that time. The church belongs to the Dominican friars. On the right side on the facade markers can be seen which show how high the water would rise sometimes. This area was prone to flooding until the banks of the Tiber were strengthened in the 19th century.</p>

<h2>Interior of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva</h2>

<p>Inside the church, an early work of Michelangelo can be seen. It is a statue representing the resurrected Christ and you can see it to the left of the altar. On the other side is a Christ on the cross, which was started by Michelangelo, but finished by another artist.</p>
<h2>The grave of Saint Catharine of Siena</h2>

<p>The grave of Saint Catharine of Siena is also inside the church. She was a Dominican nun and lived in the 14th century. She played a very big part in the return of the Pope to Rome. The Popes were living in Avignon in France at the time and she wrote them letters to convince them to come back to Rome. She also took care of lepers and the poor in the city and received stigmata, the wounds of Christ, just like Saint Francis. She died when she was 33, just like Christ. She was proclaimed patron Saint of Rome, together with Saint Francis.</p>
<h2>The grave of Fra Angelico</h2>
<figure id="attachment_306" style="width: 341px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image226.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-306" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image226.jpg?resize=341%2C455" alt="The grave of Fra Angelico" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The grave of Fra Angelico</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the floor of the chapel on the left of the main altar, you can find the grave of renaissance painter Fra Angelico, who died in the monastery next to the church in 1455.</p>
<h2>Carafa Chapel</h2>
<figure id="attachment_307" style="width: 404px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image227.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-307" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image227.jpg?resize=404%2C606" alt="Carafa Chapel" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Carafa Chapel</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the Carafa Chapel at the end of the right transept you can see frescos by Filippino Lippi with the life of Thomas of Aquino, who was a Dominican monk and Church father. Filippino was the son of famous renaissance painter Fra Filippo Lippi, who was a monk, but not a very good one. He married a nun and fathered Filipino, who became a very good painter himself as well, as you can see. Two Medici Popes (Clement VII and Leo X) are buried in the church as well in tombs made by Antonio da Sangallo. On the left side is also the tomb of Paul IV, the Pope responsible for locking the Roman Jews up in the Ghetto.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The piazza in front of the Pantheon is called Piazza della Rotonda. In the middle you can see a fountain, which was made by Giacomo della Porta in 1575. The obelisk that adorns it is from the 13th century BC, from the time of Ramses II. It was stolen by the Romans from Egypt. Romans really liked obelisks and stole so many from Egypt that there are now more Egyptian obelisks in Rome than there are in Egypt.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pantheon is one of the most impressive monuments of ancient Rome. ‘Whoever visits Rome without visiting the Pantheon, returns like an ass’ is what the Romans say. This is probably the best preserved monument from antiquity. According to legend it is built on the spot where Romulus, founder of Rome, was taken by a cloud during a thunderstorm and forever disappeared. On the frieze you can see the words M.AGRIPPA.L.F.COS. TERTIUM.FECIT which means Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius built this during his third consulate. These letters are not original, but were added later. Thanks to the holes in the frieze historians found out what the original letters said and then replicas were made. For a long time people thought the Pantheon was built in the time of Emperor Augustus. Not a strange thought, considering on the facade it says so.</p>
<p><span id="more-426"></span></p>
<p>Agrippa was one of Augustus’ most trusted advisers and his son-in-law. We now know though that the Pantheon was in fact built 150 years later, during the reign of Emperor Hadrian. Hadrian had Agrippa’s pantheon completely rebuild in 124 AD. Agrippa’s pantheon was a lot smaller and less impressive. Some people say, Hadrian himself, who was very interested in architecture and arts, designed the Pantheon himself. It was dedicated to the 7 planet gods, like Jupiter and Venus. Their statues stood in the seven niches. Hadrian probably did not change the inscription on the front because he wanted to associate himself with the reign and figure of Augustus, the first Emperor and a very popular figure.</p>
<p>Agrippa had a Pantheon built on this spot as a reward to the gods. He had planned a military expedition against the Persians, but was hesitant. Then, when he was sleeping, Cybele, the goddess of fertility appeared to him in a dream and told him to make a sacrifice to Neptune. They would both then help him in his battles. To thank the gods Agrippa promised to build the temple he saw in the same dream in their honor. Of course he was victorious and came back and built an earlier version of the Pantheon on this spot which was dedicated to Cybele and Neptune. Only in 1892 archeologists found out the building could not have been constructed in the time of Agrippa. On all the bricks marks were found that were only used in Hadrian’s time.</p>
<p>The pantheon is still standing, because in 609 it was given to the Pope by the East-Roman Emperor Phocas. The Pope then made it into a church, which is why the building is still standing. He called it Santa Maria ad Martyres and had 28 carts with bones of martyrs brought here from the catacombs to be buried.</p>
<figure id="attachment_110" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image036.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-110" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image036.jpg?resize=300%2C289" alt="Columns of the Pantheon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Columns of the Pantheon</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the front porch you can see sixteen Corinthian Columns. They are 14 meter high (46 feet). They come from Egypt and are monoliths, which mean they are made out of one piece of stone. It took a couple of years to carve one. We know exactly where in Egypt they came from, because near the ancient quarry lies a broken column which is exactly the same. Before, there was a big staircase leading up to the front porch, but the street level has risen so much the steps have disappeared.</p>
<figure id="attachment_111" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image037.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-111" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image037.jpg?resize=300%2C211" alt="Doors of the Pantheon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Doors of the Pantheon</figcaption></figure>
<p>The doors are 7 meters (23 feet) high and are covered in bronze. They are still the original doors from antiquity. In the empty spaces left and right from the doors once stood two big statues of Emperor Augustus and his friend Agrippa. When you pass through the doors the space you are in comes as a big surprise. This is intentional. From the outside it is hard to see the dome, but then when you step inside you see this amazing space all around you. The ancient architects did this on purpose.</p>
<p>The diameter and height of the Pantheon are the same: 43.30 meter. The construction of the dome was a milestone in Roman building. The invention of some form of concrete made a construction like this possible. The concrete was poured on a wooden framework which formed the dome. The dome gets thinner higher up. This is to reduce the weight. Below the dome is almost 6 meters thick, but close to the opening it is just 1.5 meters. The coffers on the roof are not only there for artistic value but also to reduce the weight of the dome. The coffers were originally decorated with bronze rosettes. The diameter of the dome is higher than that of the dome of Saint Peter’s Basilica. Renaissance architect Filippo Brunelleschi came here to study the Pantheon, before designing his dome in Florence. Michelangelo also came here to study when he designed the dome of Saint Peter’s Basilica, but he made the diameter of his dome a bit smaller, to honor the unknown architect from Roman times.</p>
<figure id="attachment_112" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image038.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-112" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image038.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Dome of the Pantheon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dome of the Pantheon</figcaption></figure>
<p>The opening in the roof is the only source of light for the building. When it rains, the water falls on the floor and flows away through small holes in the floor. The diameter of the opening is nine meters and symbolizes the sun, around which all the other planets turn.</p>
<p>It was also built as an astronomical instrument. In antiquity people valued the two equinoxes very much. These days are the 21st of March and the 22nd of September. On these dates day and night are just as long. Also the two solstices were very important. These are the days (21st of July and the 21st of December) when the sun reaches its highest or lowest point. So if you would enter the Pantheon on the 21st of June on midday the sun would touch the ground exactly in front of the main entrance. In Roman times the Emperor would enter the Pantheon in full ceremonial robe and kiss the ground.</p>
<p>The Pantheon has often been vandalized. In 1632 Pope Urban VIII of the Barberini family took the bronze beams from the front porch and melted them down to create the Baldacchino in Saint Peter’s Basilica. He stole about 250.000 kilos of bronze. He had enough bronze left to also make 40 canons for the Castel Sant&#8217;Angelo. After this the Romans say, ‘Quod non fecerunt barbari, Barberini fecerunt’; what the barbarians didn’t do, the Barberinis did. Even now, almost 2000 years after it was built it is still used as a place of worship. The marble interior is mostly original.</p>

<p>Inside, you can also see the graves of some very important people in Italian history. The first king of a united Italy is buried here, Victor Emmanuel II and his son, king Umberto I, who was murdered by an anarchist from Brescia. His wife was Margherita, after which the famous pizza was named. The pizza reflects the colors of the Italian flag: red from the tomato sauce, white from the mozzarella cheese and green from the leaf of basil.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image040.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-114" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image040.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="Tomb of Raphael" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Tomb of Raphael</figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, Raphael Sanzio, the famous painter from Urbino is buried here. On his grave is a famous line which says ‘This is Raphael&#8217;s tomb, while he lived he made Mother Nature fear to be vanquished by him and, as he died, to die too’. There is also a sign remembering Maria Bibbiena, the girl he was supposed to marry. Unfortunately Raphael died three months before the wedding was supposed to take place. He was only 37 years old. Raphael was part of an artistic brotherhood which was based in the Pantheon, I Virtuosi del Pantheon. They held exhibitions here.</p>
