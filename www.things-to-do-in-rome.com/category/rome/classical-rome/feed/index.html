				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Mamertine Prison is located just outside the Forum, between the triumphal arch of Septimus Severus and Caesar’s Forum.  It is one of the oldest surviving prisons in the world. It dates from 64 BC and was mainly used to put prisoners who were sentenced to death. Gallic general Vercingetorix was decapitated here. When Nero was in power both Peter and Paul spent time in this prison. Pope Sylvester I made it into a Church.</p>
<p>When Peter was locked inside this prison he begged his guards for water, but they refused to give him any. Peter then hit the floor three times with his cane and water appeared immediately from the floor. With this water he then proceeded to baptize his guards and cellmates. Petrus was liberated by an angel who cut his chains with his wings. There is a beautiful fresco of this scene by Raphael in the Vatican Museums.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here you can see the Temple of Venus and Roma. It was built in 135 AD under Emperor Hadrian, who might have designed it himself. He was an Emperor who was very much interested in the arts and had many buildings build throughout the empire. It was of course Hadrian who ordered the building of Hadrian’s Wall in England to keep out the Scots. Also, the pantheon was built in this time. This temple was a bit of a break with the past. It looked completely different than other Roman temples. Hadrian loved Greece and Greek culture and experts can see a clear Greek influence in the layout of the temple.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Down the Via Sacra you can see the Arch of Titus. It was built in 81 AD in honor of Emperor Titus who had quelled the rebellion in Jerusalem and had conquered that city. He took the treasure of the Temple and on the arch you can see the kind of things he took. You can see a Jewish seven-armed candleholder, a menorah, for example. Traditionally Jewish people refused to walk under the arch, but now it’s not possible for anyone to walk under it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This huge structure is the Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine. It was started by Constantine’s rival Emperor Maxentius in 308 and completed under Constantine. This building was the largest on the Forum. Half of it is still standing, the other half has disappeared. The roof was covered with gilded tiles, which were later used for the old Saint Peter’s. The building was a Roman basilica, so it did not have a religious function. It served as courtroom and marketplace. Inside, in one of the niches, a huge statue of Constantine stood.</p>
<p><span id="more-593"></span></p>
<p>The influence of this building has been enormous. Many architects took inspiration from this building, especially renaissance artists like Bramante, Brunelleschi and Michelangelo. They came here and measured everything. They were really interested in the proportions of the build. You can clearly see the influence of this building in Saint Peter’s Basilica, or for example in Raphael’s fresco ‘the school of Athens’, inside the Vatican museums.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe you already noticed the Temple of Vesta. It is a small, round temple, that is still partially standing. In this temple the Vestal Virgins always kept a ceremonial flame burning. This flame was brought to Rome by Aeneas from Troy, the Romans believed. In their house, just behind the temple they also kept pure water. People that lived in Rome always could go to see the Vestal Virgins if they needed water or fire. When Rome was just a very small settlement the Vestal virgins already existed. They lived in a small wooden temple on palatine hill, which was also round, and provided the same service for the people of the village. The fire was once a year extinguished and started again by the Pontifex Maximus, the highest priest of the Roman empire. He was the only man who was allowed to enter the house. Inside the house you can still see some names of the virgins on the pedestals on which statues once stood.</p>
<p><span id="more-591"></span></p>
<p>The Pontifex Maximus chose 6 virgins. They were girls from patrician families and were between 6 and 10 years old. After they joined the virgins their hair was cut and they were dressed in white. They then had to learn how to perform their duties for 10 years, then they had to serve for ten years and the last ten years they had to teach the new girls how to be Vestal Virgins. After these 30 years they were free. They were not allowed any sexual contact. If they did, they were put to death by being buried alive. In the history of Rome this happened only 10 times. But after the 30 years of service the Virgins were free and could also choose to lose their virginity if they wanted to, but most women preferred to stay alone, because they were used to being free. Women had very little rights when married.</p>
<p>The foundations of their house are still intact. This kind of building would later be used in the building of monasteries. You can see a courtyard; with around it cells where the Vestal virgins would live. In the middle was the basin where the pure water was held.</p>

An oracle told the Romans the ground would only close if they threw in their most valued possession. A young man, Marcus Curtius, understood what the oracle meant and mounted his horse in full body armor and then jumped inside the hole. Of course young brave soldiers were Rome’s most important possession. On this spot Emperor Galba was murdered.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This building once was the government archives. It was called the Tabularium. It was built on the slope of Capitoline hill. Big parts can still be visited, but from within the Capitoline museums. As you can see the lower part of the building is made out of ancient stones, but the upper part is more modern. This is because the modern city hall was built on top of the Tabularium in the renaissance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Higher up on the Forum Romanum you can see the Temple of Saturn. It is originally from the 5th century BC. This temple housed the treasury of the state. Also, weapons were kept here in case the Gauls would show up. Saturn was the father of Jupiter. He ruled as the highest god before him. He once heard a prophecy that one of his sons would one day take his place, so every time he fathered a son he would immediately eat him. Jupiter’s mother was smart. Instead of giving Saturn his son to eat, she wrapped a stone in a cloth and Saturn ate the stone. He never found out, until Jupiter grew up and replaced him as Highest God.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the middle, in front of the actual forum, you can see the Rostrum. This used to be a stage on which important speeches were held. Marc Anthony held his famous speech here after Julius Caesar had been killed. What he exactly said is unknown to us, but many people know Shakespeare’s rendition of the speech which starts with the famous words: Friends, Romans, Countrymen. Can you see the vertical lines on the front wall of the Rostra? Augustus had attached prows of the ships he had destroyed at the battle of Actium.</p>
<p>Cicero held many speeches here, including 14 very hostile speeches against Marc Anthony. He later took revenge by ordering the killing of Cicero and displaying his hands and head on the stage. It is said that more people came to see his head than had ever come to see his speeches.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the spot where the senate held its sessions. It once started with 100 senators, but in the time of Caesar there were 900. Emperor Augustus reduced their number to 600. The building burned down in 52 BC in the time of Julius Caesar. He paid for the restoration, but the senate was temporarily moved across town. So Caesar was not murdered on this spot, because at that time the building was being reconstructed. The present building is another reconstruction from the time of Diocletian in the 3rd century. Why do you think it is still standing? This is, as almost always with ancient constructions, because it was transformed into a church. Mussolini then changed it back to how it was before.</p>
<p><span id="more-566"></span></p>
<p>The senators sat on seats that were placed on the long side. Inside the Curia you can see Emperor Trajan’s Plutei, fragments of the old stage in front of the Curia. On it you can a carving of the so called Suovetaurilia. This was a sacrifice in which a pig (sus), a sheep (ovis) and a bull (taurus) were offered. The bronze doors are copies, but the original ones still exist. Architect Borromini moved them to Saint John in Lateran, where they still are.</p>
<p>The paved space in front of the Curia was the Comitium. The people of Rome would meet here to hold important meetings. Here, a long time ago, stood the Ficus Ruminalis. This was the fig tree on which the casket with Romulus and Remus had stopped while they were floating down the Tiber (remember the forum was a swamp before, connected to the river).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The triumphal arch of Septimus Severus was built in 203 AD in remembrance of his 10 years as Emperor and because of his victory against the Parthians. It was also dedicated to his sons Caracalla and Geta, but when Caracalla became Emperor he had his brother murdered and all references to his brother were taken down from the arch. You can see that there is a hole somewhere in the fourth line of the inscription. This is where Geta’s name could be read. In the middle ages the arch stood half in the earth and a barber shop was run from under there. Caracalla’s real name was Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus Pius Felix but his nickname was Caracalla, which was the name of the Gallic Cape he always wore and made fashionable.</p>
<p><span id="more-562"></span></p>
<p>The area in front of the arch used to be the actual Forum, the market square. Only three trees stood here, they were a fig tree, an olive tree and a vine, which symbolized the essential foods of the Romans. Augustus had the forum paved with the travertine stones which you still can see.</p>
<figure id="attachment_203" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image126.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-203" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image126.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Umbilicus Urbis" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Umbilicus Urbis</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next to the arch is the base of the Umbilicus Urbis. This spot marked the heart of the city, the bellybutton of Rome. You must have heard the expression ‘All roads lead to Rome’. All roads lead to Rome and all those roads would lead to this point.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the middle of the Forum Romanum you can see the Temple of Castor and Pollux. Only three Corinthian columns are still standing. It was built in 484 BC. Castor and Pollux were twins. Their father was Jupiter, who had seduced their mother Leda by taking the shape of a swan. Castor and Pollux were then born out of eggs. They were very important for the Romans. They believed the twins had helped them during an important battle against the Latin people at the lake of Regilius in 486 BC. After the battle 2 strong unknown warriors were seen on this spot, giving water to their horses. Afterwards these warriors disappeared but the Romans believed they had been Castor and Pollux. Then a temple was built on this spot.</p>
<p><span id="more-560"></span></p>
<p>The twins were not true gods, because their mother had been mortal. So when it turned out one died and the other one was immortal they were very sad. One was living in the underworld and the other one on earth. They wanted to stay together so their father put them as stars in heaven as the sign Gemini, twins.</p>

The temple was built on the place where the body of Julius Caesar was burned after he had been murdered in the senate. You can walk inside and see a space which used to be an altar. On it you probably see flowers. This was the exact sport Caesar was burned. Still the romans remember him by putting flowers. On the 15th of March, the day Caesar died, flowers are put here, but also on other days.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Temple is the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina. Antoninus is not a very famous Emperor. He was one of the adoptive Emperors. After Emperor Domitian became crazy and was murdered the senate decided that a new system for appointing Emperors had to be found. So they appointed one of their own, Nerva, Emperor. Nerva was not allowed to let his son be Emperor, but he had to adopt a promising young man as his successor. So Nerva adopted Trajan, who became one of the best Emperors, Trajan adopted Hadrian and Hadrian adopted Antoninus Pius. Antoninus is not very famous even though he was a very good Emperor. This is because during his reign nothing happened. The empire was at peace and a lot of people prospered. Antoninus then adopted Marcus Aurelius, who made his son Commodus Emperor. If you have ever seen the movie Gladiator you know that this did not work out very well.</p>
<p><span id="more-555"></span></p>
<p>This temple was built by Antoninus for his wife Faustina after she died. After his death it was dedicated to him as well. Emperors were always declared a god after they died. The Emperor who ordered the building of the Colosseum, Vespasian said some famous last words before he died. He said, Oh my, I think I am becoming a God. The building is still standing, unlike most buildings on the forum. This is because it was transformed into a church in the middle ages. In 1602 the building got a baroque facade.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you walk down you can see the foundation of the Basilica Aemilia on your right side. It was built in 197 BC. This building was meant to protect people from the rain or the sun. The activities that took place outside on the forum had to be continued on rainy days. it was some sort of trade center. Also, magistrates would hold trials here. That is also where the name comes from. Basilica comes from the Greek word Basileus, which means king. Of course, in ancient times it was the king who would administer justice. It was paid for by the Aemilia family, which was one of the most powerful families at that time.</p>
<p><span id="more-553"></span></p>
<p>It was destroyed in 410 by Alaric, the famous king of the Goths who sacked Rome. You probably know the word Basilica as a name for a church. This is because the first Christians used this type of construction for their first churches. The form of the classical temple was not suited to hold mass.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Forum Romanum once was the heart of Rome. From the 6th century BC onward, this was the place where the most important public buildings stood. It was the political and social center of first the republic and then the empire. Forum means market in Latin, so it all started as the main market square of the city. Before, this area was a swamp. Archaeologists have discovered that the romans added 5 meters of sand to this area so it could be used as a market. Also, a very large drain was constructed, the cloaca maxima, which transported rain water directly to the Tiber. The forum lies between Palatine hill and Capitoline hill. Of course now not much is left. If you walk around without realizing where you stand it is not a very impressive place. Now, of most buildings only the foundations are left. In the middle ages and the renaissance this area was used like a quarry, like the Colosseum. In fact, if you enter a medieval church in Rome you can often notice how every pillar is different. This is because they were taken from different Roman buildings.</p>
<p><span id="more-551"></span></p>
<p>In Roman times this place must have been very impressive. This is where the senate building stood. There was a podium on which famous romans held speeches, like Cicero and Marc Anthony. Many temples and courthouses stood here. Roman writer Plautus described a normal day on the forum like this:</p>
<p>‘If you need somebody for perjury, you should have a look at the area where meetings are held. Impostors and loud people you can find near the Temple of Cloacina. Rich folks that squander their money can be found in the shade of the hall of the market. There you can find withered prostitutes and all sorts of touts. In the lower market the rich citizens lounge around and on the middle forum, near the sewer you can see only posers.’</p>
<p>After the capital of the empire was moved to Constantinople the importance of the forum started decreasing. In the middle ages the center of the city moved northwest to the area near Piazza Navona. The place the forum used to be became known as the Campo Vacino, or the Cow’s field. Only in the 19th century the first scientific excavations were started.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here you can see the Forum of Trajan. Much of this amazing complex is still standing. Trajan was the first Emperor that was not from Rome. He was born in Spain, but from a family of Roman colonists. He was a promising young general when he was adopted by Emperor Nerva. He was a great strategist and won many wars. He conquered the Dacians, whom we now call the Romanians. He is the reason the Romanians still speak a Romance language and so many Romanians come to Italy to look for work. It is very easy for them to learn Italian.</p>
<p>Trajan also builds a lot of public buildings, like Vespasian and Titus before him. They also did not build a lot of buildings for themselves, because they wanted to consolidate their reign by pleasing the public.</p>
<figure id="attachment_165" style="width: 225px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image091.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-165" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image091.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="Trajan's Column" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Trajan&#8217;s Column</figcaption></figure>
<p>Trajan’s forum was finished in 113. He paid for it with the money he made conquering the Dacians. The territory of the Dacians was filled with gold mines. He wanted to build the most impressive of Imperial Forums. His architect was the Apollodorus of Damascus, the most famous architect of that time. The most famous monument on his Forum is still standing. It is Trajan’s Column. On the column you can see the story of Trajan’s conquest of the Dacians in a spiral bas relief. Once the column was painted in bright colors, but now it is just white. It is almost 40 meters high (131 feet). The bas relief tells the story of Trajan’s victory. It is a very interesting source for historians. You can see the Romans build bridges, set up camp and engaging in battle, all in a very realistic style. There are about 2500 figures visible and they are all of high artistic quality. Inside there are stairs which lead to the top.</p>
<p>On top there is now a statue of Saint Peter, which was put there to show Christianity goes above paganism. Originally there was a statue of Trajan there. After Trajan died, his ashes were held in a golden urn at the base of the column. According to a Roman legend, Trajan made it to heaven in the end, although he was never Christian. When Pope Gregory I the great visited the forum in the 6th century he looked at the column and saw a picture of Trajan comforting a woman who had lost her son. Gregory was deeply touched that he prayed for the soul of the deceased Emperor. His prayers were answered because he managed to bring the ashes temporarily back to life. He then baptized Trajan who could then enter heaven. The column is probably still standing because it was used as a bell tower for a medieval church, which now has long disappeared.</p>
<p>Behind the column you can see the actual forum. It was an enormous market and is still standing. It was basically a shopping mall. There were 150 shops on 6 floors. It is made out of brick, which had just been discovered. Downstairs probably dry foods like sugar and flour were sold and you could go upstairs to buy oil and wine. The medieval tower behind the forum is from the 13th century and is called the Torre delle Milizie. Soldiers were based here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Across the Via dei Fori Imperiali some parts of the Forum of Nerva can be seen. Once, a nice temple of Minerva stood here. You can see all the forums are below the current level of the street. This is because during the last two millennia the city has become higher. You could call this due to the dust of ages. During the middle ages this area was not really used anymore. Cows were held here and slowly, thanks to dust and manure, the level of the ground rose considerably, until archeologist started digging in the 19th century.</p>
<figure id="attachment_163" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image089.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-163" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image089.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="The Forum of Augustus" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Forum of Augustus</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next to the forum of Nerva you can see what is left of the Forum of Augustus. He also built a temple in honor of the god of war Mars here when he won a battle against the murderers of Caesar, his adoptive father. Only three of the 24 columns are left.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The forum of Vespasian is part of the imperial fora that Emperors build, because the forum Romanum, the main market and square of Rome became too small. The remains of these fora can be found under the main <em>Via dei Fori Imperiali, </em>which was constructed under Mussolini. In the map above you can see this main road going across with a map of the old Imperial Fora over it. Big parts of the Imperial fora are buried under the street, but because the street is one of the main traffic arteries of Rome, it will stay under ground. Recently there has been a move to pedestrianize the <em>Via dei Fori Imperiali. </em>The idea is to make the biggest archeological park of Europe, including the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, the Forum Romanum and the Imperial Fora. So far only the traffic in the street has been reduced. Taxis and busses are still allowed to pass.</p>
<figure id="attachment_161" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image087.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-161" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image087.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="Church of Cosma and Damiano" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Church of Cosma and Damiano</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Forum of Vespasian is almost completely gone. You still can visit the church of the Saints Cosma and Damiano, which was built inside what probably once was the library of the Forum.</p>
