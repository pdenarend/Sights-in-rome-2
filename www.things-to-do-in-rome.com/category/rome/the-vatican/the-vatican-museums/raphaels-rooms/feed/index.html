				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This room in the Vatican is called the Stanza del Incendio. Incendio means fire in Italian. This room was the Private dining room of the Pope.</p>
<p>The most famous fresco in this room was done by Raphael himself and it is called the Fire in the Borgo. It celebrates a miracle that took place in 847. There was a great fire in the Borgo, which is the residential area around the Vatican. Pope Leo IV appeared on the balcony and made the sign of the cross and the fire was miraculously extinguished. It is also interesting because behind the Pope we can see the façade of the old Saint Peters, the basilica that was built in the time of Emperor Constantine.</p>

<figure id="attachment_264" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image186.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-264" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image186.jpg?resize=300%2C226" alt="Fire in the Borgo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fire in the Borgo</figcaption></figure>
<p>The figures on the left on the forefront is an allusion to the story of Aeneas who is fleeing from a burning Troy. He is considered the forefather of the roman people. You see him escaping with his son and with his father on his back. The Vestal Virgin, Rhea Silvia, who was the mother of the twins Romulus and Remus was a direct descendant of Aeneas and of course it was Romulus founded Rome, the city that still bears his name.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image187.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-265" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image187.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="The Battle of Ostia" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Battle of Ostia</figcaption></figure>
<p>The rest of the room was done by students. You can see the battle of Ostia. Here we see the Pope winning a battle against the Saracens at Ostia, then the harbor of Rome.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image188.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-266" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image188.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="The Coronation of Charlemagne" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Coronation of Charlemagne</figcaption></figure>
<p>Coronation of Charlemagne Here we see the coronation of Charlemagne by the Pope in the year 800. This really happened on Christmas Eve in the old Saint Peter&#8217;s Basilica. Charlemagne was crowned Emperor by the Pope. This was very important for the papacy, because this way the Pope could say that his authority was higher than that of Emperors.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the most famous room of Raphael, the Stanza della Segnatura, which was painted from 1508 to 1512. It was meant to become the library of Julius II, but afterwards became room where most important Papal documents were signed and sealed. So it is called the room of the Segnatura, which means signing.</p>
<p>The School of Athens is the most important in this room.  This fresco represents rational wisdom. We see a debate on the search for truth between Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle. They are the two figures in the middle both holding their most famous books in their hand. Plato holds the republic and Aristotle his Etica. Raphael gave Plato the face of Leonardo da Vinci, putting him at par with Plato. Aristotle is on his right. Many figures have the faces of Raphael’s contemporaries, but unfortunately we are not quite sure who is who. Some figures however are recognizable.</p>
<p><span id="more-722"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_262" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image184.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-262" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image184.jpg?resize=300%2C233" alt="School of Athens by Raphael" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">School of Athens by Raphael</figcaption></figure>
<p>The bent over bald man explaining a theory with a compass has the face of Raphael’s friend Donato Bramante, the first architect to work on the new Saint Peters for Pope Julius II. The architectural space in which the figures stand is clearly inspired by Bramante’s work.</p>
<p>Raphael worked in this room at the same time Michelangelo was painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. According to legend Raphael sometimes would sneak in in to see what Michelangelo was doing and was really inspired by what he saw. So we can clearly see the influence of Michelangelo in the big figures in this fresco. He also painted Michelangelo, which is the figure sitting alone on the steps, thinking. Michelangelo was an artist who was always by himself and a bit of a loner so that’s why he is sitting by himself on the steps.</p>
<p>Raphael also added himself again, you can see him to the far right behind the guy in white (which is a portrait of Sodoma, who was his teacher). Raphael is the one with the black hat.</p>
<figure id="attachment_263" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image185.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-263" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image185.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Disputation of the Holy Sacrament" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Disputation of the Holy Sacrament</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other side of the wall you can see the disputation of the holy sacrament. This one represents the other form of wisdom, which is theological wisdom. So together with the school of Athens all forms of wisdom are represented: Godly and Manly wisdom. We see Popes and Saints on earth debating about the nature of the holy sacrament and above, up in heaven the same debate is being held.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the room of Heliodorus, painted from 1512-1514. This was the second room to be painted and would have been the private chamber of the apartments. Just a few paintings here were painted by Raphael himself.</p>
<p>The first fresco which you can see in the picture above is the Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple. This fresco was completed by Raphael himself. It represents the biblical story of Heliodorus who was sent by the King of Syria to steal the treasure of the Temple of Jerusalem. You see him laying on the ground on the right. The high priest on the left prayed to god who sent a horseman to drive Heliodorus out. The High priest is a portrait of Pope Julius II. Raphael has also added a portrait of himself next to the people carrying away the Pope.</p>
<p><span id="more-720"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_259" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image181.jpg"><img class="wp-image-259 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image181.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="Attila" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Attila</figcaption></figure>
<p>The next fresco is the meeting of Leo I with Attila, which was completed by students.  Attila the Hun is convinced by Pope Leo the Great not to attack Rome in 452. This really happened. We don’t know exactly how Leo did it, but the fact is Attila retreated after meeting the Pope outside the city gates.</p>
<p>Here we see Leo is assisted by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, who frighten Attila in retreating. If you look at the face of the cardinal in the forefront behind the Pope and then look at the face of the Pope; you can see that it is the same face. Julius II died and Raphael made his students paint the face of the new Pope and it was the cardinal painted behind the Pope that became the new Pope.</p>
<figure id="attachment_260" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image182.jpg"><img class="wp-image-260 size-full" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image182.jpg?resize=600%2C451" alt="The Mass at Bolsena" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Mass at Bolsena</figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there is the Mass at Bolsena is by Raphael. Here we see a priest who had doubts about the presence of Christ in the Eucharist, or the bread you get at mass. During a mass he saw blood pour out of the sacred host and his doubts disappeared. You can see Pope Julius II, always recognizable by his long white beard, kneeling in front of the priest. You can also see the Swiss guards down below.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image183.jpg"><img class="wp-image-261 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image183.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="The Liberation of Peter" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Liberation of Peter</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of Raphael&#8217;s masterpieces is the liberation of St Peter by Raphael above the window.  Here we see the story of how an angel appeared to St Peter who was locked up in prison. The angel asked him to stand up and when he did his chains fell off and the angel led him out into the street, while the guards were sleeping.</p>
<p>You can see the guards waking up in bewilderment to find out that the prisoner is missing. If you look at the face of Saint Peter you can see that it is the face of Julius II. This fresco is considered a masterpiece because of the light that emanates from it and the nice contrast which is created by the darkness of the prison bars. The bars were not painted al secco, or added on later. They were incorporated into the fresco at same time. This is very difficult to do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Raphael rooms would have been Julius II private apartments. He moved here because he did not want to live in the apartments of one of his predecessors and his archenemy, Rodrigo Borgia, Pope Alexander VI. Also he thought the ceilings of the Borgia apartments were painted with scenes of debauchery. Donato Bramante, the famous first architect of the new Saint Peters, suggested Raphael Sanzio to Julius II for the painting of the rooms. Raphael was only 25 at the time and not a very well-known artist. It took a total of 16 years to complete all the rooms. Raphael worked on them from 1508 to 1520, but then he died, so the rooms were finished by his students.</p>
<p>The first room is the room of Constantine. It is the first room we enter, but it was the last to be painted. This room was used for receptions and official ceremonies. It’s based on designs by Raphael, but all done by his students, like Giulio Romano. The main theme of the room is the Triumph of Christianity over Paganism. If you look up to the ceiling you can see this theme depicted. A roman statue of a god lies broken on the floor while a crucifix is standing up.</p>
<p>The four major paintings show scenes from the life of Emperor Constantine, a very important Emperor who legalized Christianity.</p>
<p><span id="more-718"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_254" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image176.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-254" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image176.jpg?resize=300%2C194" alt="The Vision of Constantine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Vision of Constantine</figcaption></figure>
<p>The first one represents the Vision of the Cross. Constantine wanted to become to sole ruler of the Roman Empire and so he had to defeat his rival Maxentius. Before the final battle he had a vision. An angel appeared and told him that if he fought in the sign of the cross he would be victories. The angel said ‘In hoc signo Vinces’ In this sign you will conquer. You can see the angel saying this but in Greek on the fresco. The next day Constantine had crosses painted on all of his soldier’s shields and in the battle at the Milvian Bridge he was victorious. You can see Constantine in his camp standing in front of his tent looking up to the sign of the cross in the sky.</p>
<figure id="attachment_255" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image177.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-255" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image177.jpg?resize=300%2C196" alt="The Battle at the Milvian Bridge" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Battle at the Milvian Bridge</figcaption></figure>
<p>The next fresco depicts the Battle at the Milvian Bridge. This is a bridge north of Rome which still exists. You can see Constantine victorious. He is the one on the white horse with a golden armor and a spear in his hands. The evil Maxentius drowns in the Tiber on his brown horse, looking at Constantine. You can also see that Constantine is protected by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, who are flying above Constantine during the battle.</p>
<figure id="attachment_256" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image178.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-256" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image178.jpg?resize=300%2C195" alt="The Baptism of Constantine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Baptism of Constantine</figcaption></figure>
<p>The next one represents the Baptism of Constantine. Constantine suffered of leprosy and his pagan advisers advised him to bathe in an innocent’s child blood. St Peter and St Paul appeared to him and told him to find Pope Sylvester I. Constantine then was baptized by the Pope and miraculously cured. This legend seems to be a fabrication however.</p>
<p>Most historians agree that if Constantine ever was baptized it was just before dying, because he believed it was impossible to be a good Emperor and a good Christian at the same time. Constantine did legalize Christianity though in the year 313 with the edict of Milan. The influence of Constantine on western history was almost unparalleled because of this. Before the Emperor started to favor Christianity about 5% of the population of the empire was Christian. After Constantine about 60% became Christian.</p>
<figure id="attachment_257" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image179.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-257" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image179.jpg?resize=300%2C195" alt="The Donation of Constantine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Donation of Constantine</figcaption></figure>
<p>The last fresco is the Donation of Constantine. For a long time it was believed that when Constantine left Rome to found Constantinople, he left his temporal power to Pope Sylvester I. The church was in possession of a document that claimed the papacy was the rightful ruler of the whole western world. For a long time Popes based their temporal power on this document. In the renaissance this document was discovered to be a forgery. The Latin used could never have been written in the time of Constantine and it was clear the document was written many centuries after the death of Constantine. On the fresco we see the Emperor kneeling before the Pope. This is pure propaganda! Emperors should kneel for Popes.</p>
