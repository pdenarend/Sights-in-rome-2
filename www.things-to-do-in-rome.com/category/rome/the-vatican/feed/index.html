				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Michelangelo was finished with the ceiling he hoped never to paint again. He went on and created many more beautiful sculptures but after 24 years a new Pope decided he wanted Michelangelo to finish what he had started. It was Pope Paul III who became a very important patron of Michelangelo. Not only did he commission him to paint the last judgment in the Sistine chapel, he also convinced him that he would be a good architect. So he made him chief architect of Saint Peter’s, made him design a new Capitoline Hill and gave him many more project.</p>
<p>Michelangelo was now in his sixties, He started painting the Last Judgment, the enormous fresco you see painted at the altar wall in 1535 and finished 1541. It took him six years to finish. Two windows from the altar wall had to be closed and other frescos destroyed, including parts of Michelangelo’s own work.</p>
<p>The tone of this work is very different from that of the ceiling. The ceiling is about the coming of the savior. This work is much darker. It is the last judgment.</p>
<p><span id="more-731"></span></p>
<h2>Christ</h2>
<figure id="attachment_284" style="width: 214px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image204.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-284" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image204.jpg?resize=214%2C300" alt="The Last Judgement by Michelangelo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Last Judgement by Michelangelo</figcaption></figure>
<p>High in the middle of the fresco we see Christ. Now, does he look like the traditional Christ you see in other paintings? Not at all. He is beardless and very muscular. He looks almost like a classical god, which is not so strange to think, because Michelangelo used two statues we have seen earlier as a model for Christ. For his head he used the statue of the Apollo belvedere which we saw in the octagonal courtyard, and for his body he used the Belvedere Torso. He is a powerful figure. With one hand he raises the dead from their graves and with the other one he judges. He decides who goes to heaven and who goes to hell.</p>
<h2>The angels</h2>
<figure id="attachment_285" style="width: 188px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image205.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-285" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image205.jpg?resize=188%2C300" alt="The angels" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The angels</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you look below Christ you these wingless angels with trumpets. They awaken the dead. They carry two books. One book contains the list of the blessed souls and one of the damned. Can you guess which one is which? Of course the small book contains the list of the blessed. Only very few people will go to heaven, most will go to hell.</p>
<h2>Historical background</h2>
<p>The fresco has a very dark subject. This has everything to do with the time it was painted in. 24 years had passed since Michelangelo painted the ceiling and the positive spirit of the renaissance had faded. In 1527 the troops of Emperor Charles V had sacked Rome and Michelangelo was there when it happened. It is said this was the worst sack of the city ever, including the ones by the barbarians after the fall of the west-roman empire. Priests were murdered, nuns were raped, artworks destroyed. The unfinished basilica of Saint Peter’s was used as a stable.</p>
<p>Also in 1517 another thing had happened. In Germany there was an Augustinian monk who absolutely did not like the way the Popes were behaving. Traveling monks were selling indulgences in Germany to fund the building of Saint Peter’s and the many wars the Popes were fighting. If you bought an indulgence you could secure your place in heaven according to the Pope. This monk started a protest and in 1517 he put 95 theses on the church door in Wittenberg where he lived at the time. His name of course was Martin Luther and he started the protestant revolution. The Catholic Church lost many believers in the northern parts of Europe.</p>
<p>So the message in the fresco is beware of what you do. You have to follow the right path, the catholic path or else you are going to go to hell. Next to Christ we can see Saint Peter. His face is a portrait of Pope Paul III. We also can see on the left side a figure who is pulled up to heaven by an angel using a rosary. Of course Luther had said that rosaries are useless, so this is a clear attack on Luther by Michelangelo.</p>
<h2>Saints</h2>
<figure id="attachment_286" style="width: 213px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image206.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-286" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image206.jpg?resize=213%2C300" alt="Saint Bartholomew" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Saint Bartholomew</figcaption></figure>
<p>Around Christ we see many Saints. On the right side with the keys to heaven in his hand we can see Saint Peter. This is a portrait of Pope Paul III. On the right side below Christ we see Saint Bartholomew. He is holding his own skin in his handed because he was skinned alive. Now if you look at the skin it is not the same as Saint Bartholomew. It is actually a portrait of Michelangelo. He shows himself empty and tired because of all the work he had to do.</p>
<p>Left of Bartholomew we see Saint Lawrence. He is holding a grill in his hand because he was grilled alive. He was martyred during the reign of Emperor Valerian. According to legend they grilled him alive and at a certain point Lawrence lifted himself up and said ‘You can turn me over now, this side is done’.</p>
<p>Above him you can see Saint Andrew with his back turned to us. He is recognizable by the cross he is holding which is shaped like an X.</p>
<p>Left of Andrew we see Saint John and to his right side you see Mary next to Christ. She turns her head, because she is sorry for the people that go to hell.</p>
<p>All these figures represent the most important Churches in Rome. Saint Peters, Santa Maria Maggiore, Saint John in Lateran etc.</p>
<figure id="attachment_287" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image207.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-287" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image207.jpg?resize=300%2C186" alt="Angels with the Cross" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Angels with the Cross</figcaption></figure>
<p>Above Christ you can see angels holding up his crown of thorns, the Cross and the pillar against which Christ was whipped.</p>
<p>Then on your right side you can see this group of Saints. You can see Saint Sebastian all the way on the right, holding the arrows he was pierced with in his hand. Next to him is Saint Catherine of Alexandria, holding the wheel which she was tortured on. Now if you would go to the Capodimonte museum in Naples you could see a copy of this fresco done by an artist a few years after Michelangelo had finished. The amazing thing is that on this copy all these figures are naked. These were all dressed after Michelangelo had died and in the rest of the fresco many private parts were covered up, because later Popes thought the painting was indecent.</p>
<h2>Hell</h2>
<p>Then lastly on the right side just above the door we see hell. People are brought to Hell on a boat by Charon, a classical depiction of hell. In hell itself we see a man with ears like an ass and a snake around him. The snake bites him in a very unpleasant spot. This is a portrait of Biago de Cesena, who was the Pope’s master of ceremonies. When he saw the fresco when Michelangelo was working on it he said it belonged in a brothel and not in a church. This, because there were so many naked pictures in the painting. Michelangelo heard this and painted him in Hell as Minos, the judge of the underworld. Of course Biago was furious and went to see the Pope to complain. But Paul III said that as Pope he just had power over heaven, but whatever happened in hell he could not influence. So Biago is still there.</p>
<h2>Restoration</h2>
<p>The chapel was restored between 1981 and 1993. It took 12 years to restore what one man painted in ten years. The company that paid for the restoration was Nippon, a Japanese TV network. They paid 100 million dollars. It took hundred experts to restore everything. What Nippon asked for in return was exclusive photography right of the Sistine chapel for 10 years. What the art historians amazed the most after the restoration was done were the colors of the chapel. It turned out Michelangelo had used much brighter colors than anybody had ever believed. Because of candle smoke the frescoes had become dark, but when they were restored people at first thought the restorers had repainted the ceiling.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This room in the Vatican is called the Stanza del Incendio. Incendio means fire in Italian. This room was the Private dining room of the Pope.</p>
<p>The most famous fresco in this room was done by Raphael himself and it is called the Fire in the Borgo. It celebrates a miracle that took place in 847. There was a great fire in the Borgo, which is the residential area around the Vatican. Pope Leo IV appeared on the balcony and made the sign of the cross and the fire was miraculously extinguished. It is also interesting because behind the Pope we can see the façade of the old Saint Peters, the basilica that was built in the time of Emperor Constantine.</p>

<p>The figures on the left on the forefront is an allusion to the story of Aeneas who is fleeing from a burning Troy. He is considered the forefather of the roman people. You see him escaping with his son and with his father on his back. The Vestal Virgin, Rhea Silvia, who was the mother of the twins Romulus and Remus was a direct descendant of Aeneas and of course it was Romulus founded Rome, the city that still bears his name.</p>
<figure id="attachment_265" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image187.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-265" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image187.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="The Battle of Ostia" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Battle of Ostia</figcaption></figure>
<p>The rest of the room was done by students. You can see the battle of Ostia. Here we see the Pope winning a battle against the Saracens at Ostia, then the harbor of Rome.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image188.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-266" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image188.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="The Coronation of Charlemagne" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Coronation of Charlemagne</figcaption></figure>
<p>Coronation of Charlemagne Here we see the coronation of Charlemagne by the Pope in the year 800. This really happened on Christmas Eve in the old Saint Peter&#8217;s Basilica. Charlemagne was crowned Emperor by the Pope. This was very important for the papacy, because this way the Pope could say that his authority was higher than that of Emperors.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the most famous room of Raphael, the Stanza della Segnatura, which was painted from 1508 to 1512. It was meant to become the library of Julius II, but afterwards became room where most important Papal documents were signed and sealed. So it is called the room of the Segnatura, which means signing.</p>
<p>The School of Athens is the most important in this room.  This fresco represents rational wisdom. We see a debate on the search for truth between Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle. They are the two figures in the middle both holding their most famous books in their hand. Plato holds the republic and Aristotle his Etica. Raphael gave Plato the face of Leonardo da Vinci, putting him at par with Plato. Aristotle is on his right. Many figures have the faces of Raphael’s contemporaries, but unfortunately we are not quite sure who is who. Some figures however are recognizable.</p>
<p><span id="more-722"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_262" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image184.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-262" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image184.jpg?resize=300%2C233" alt="School of Athens by Raphael" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">School of Athens by Raphael</figcaption></figure>
<p>The bent over bald man explaining a theory with a compass has the face of Raphael’s friend Donato Bramante, the first architect to work on the new Saint Peters for Pope Julius II. The architectural space in which the figures stand is clearly inspired by Bramante’s work.</p>
<p>Raphael worked in this room at the same time Michelangelo was painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. According to legend Raphael sometimes would sneak in in to see what Michelangelo was doing and was really inspired by what he saw. So we can clearly see the influence of Michelangelo in the big figures in this fresco. He also painted Michelangelo, which is the figure sitting alone on the steps, thinking. Michelangelo was an artist who was always by himself and a bit of a loner so that’s why he is sitting by himself on the steps.</p>
<p>Raphael also added himself again, you can see him to the far right behind the guy in white (which is a portrait of Sodoma, who was his teacher). Raphael is the one with the black hat.</p>
<figure id="attachment_263" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image185.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-263" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image185.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Disputation of the Holy Sacrament" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Disputation of the Holy Sacrament</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other side of the wall you can see the disputation of the holy sacrament. This one represents the other form of wisdom, which is theological wisdom. So together with the school of Athens all forms of wisdom are represented: Godly and Manly wisdom. We see Popes and Saints on earth debating about the nature of the holy sacrament and above, up in heaven the same debate is being held.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the room of Heliodorus, painted from 1512-1514. This was the second room to be painted and would have been the private chamber of the apartments. Just a few paintings here were painted by Raphael himself.</p>
<p>The first fresco which you can see in the picture above is the Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple. This fresco was completed by Raphael himself. It represents the biblical story of Heliodorus who was sent by the King of Syria to steal the treasure of the Temple of Jerusalem. You see him laying on the ground on the right. The high priest on the left prayed to god who sent a horseman to drive Heliodorus out. The High priest is a portrait of Pope Julius II. Raphael has also added a portrait of himself next to the people carrying away the Pope.</p>
<p><span id="more-720"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_259" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image181.jpg"><img class="wp-image-259 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image181.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="Attila" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Attila</figcaption></figure>
<p>The next fresco is the meeting of Leo I with Attila, which was completed by students.  Attila the Hun is convinced by Pope Leo the Great not to attack Rome in 452. This really happened. We don’t know exactly how Leo did it, but the fact is Attila retreated after meeting the Pope outside the city gates.</p>
<p>Here we see Leo is assisted by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, who frighten Attila in retreating. If you look at the face of the cardinal in the forefront behind the Pope and then look at the face of the Pope; you can see that it is the same face. Julius II died and Raphael made his students paint the face of the new Pope and it was the cardinal painted behind the Pope that became the new Pope.</p>
<figure id="attachment_260" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image182.jpg"><img class="wp-image-260 size-full" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image182.jpg?resize=600%2C451" alt="The Mass at Bolsena" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Mass at Bolsena</figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there is the Mass at Bolsena is by Raphael. Here we see a priest who had doubts about the presence of Christ in the Eucharist, or the bread you get at mass. During a mass he saw blood pour out of the sacred host and his doubts disappeared. You can see Pope Julius II, always recognizable by his long white beard, kneeling in front of the priest. You can also see the Swiss guards down below.</p>

<p>One of Raphael&#8217;s masterpieces is the liberation of St Peter by Raphael above the window.  Here we see the story of how an angel appeared to St Peter who was locked up in prison. The angel asked him to stand up and when he did his chains fell off and the angel led him out into the street, while the guards were sleeping.</p>
<p>You can see the guards waking up in bewilderment to find out that the prisoner is missing. If you look at the face of Saint Peter you can see that it is the face of Julius II. This fresco is considered a masterpiece because of the light that emanates from it and the nice contrast which is created by the darkness of the prison bars. The bars were not painted al secco, or added on later. They were incorporated into the fresco at same time. This is very difficult to do.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Raphael rooms would have been Julius II private apartments. He moved here because he did not want to live in the apartments of one of his predecessors and his archenemy, Rodrigo Borgia, Pope Alexander VI. Also he thought the ceilings of the Borgia apartments were painted with scenes of debauchery. Donato Bramante, the famous first architect of the new Saint Peters, suggested Raphael Sanzio to Julius II for the painting of the rooms. Raphael was only 25 at the time and not a very well-known artist. It took a total of 16 years to complete all the rooms. Raphael worked on them from 1508 to 1520, but then he died, so the rooms were finished by his students.</p>
<p>The first room is the room of Constantine. It is the first room we enter, but it was the last to be painted. This room was used for receptions and official ceremonies. It’s based on designs by Raphael, but all done by his students, like Giulio Romano. The main theme of the room is the Triumph of Christianity over Paganism. If you look up to the ceiling you can see this theme depicted. A roman statue of a god lies broken on the floor while a crucifix is standing up.</p>
<p>The four major paintings show scenes from the life of Emperor Constantine, a very important Emperor who legalized Christianity.</p>
<p><span id="more-718"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_254" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image176.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-254" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image176.jpg?resize=300%2C194" alt="The Vision of Constantine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Vision of Constantine</figcaption></figure>
<p>The first one represents the Vision of the Cross. Constantine wanted to become to sole ruler of the Roman Empire and so he had to defeat his rival Maxentius. Before the final battle he had a vision. An angel appeared and told him that if he fought in the sign of the cross he would be victories. The angel said ‘In hoc signo Vinces’ In this sign you will conquer. You can see the angel saying this but in Greek on the fresco. The next day Constantine had crosses painted on all of his soldier’s shields and in the battle at the Milvian Bridge he was victorious. You can see Constantine in his camp standing in front of his tent looking up to the sign of the cross in the sky.</p>
<figure id="attachment_255" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image177.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-255" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image177.jpg?resize=300%2C196" alt="The Battle at the Milvian Bridge" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Battle at the Milvian Bridge</figcaption></figure>
<p>The next fresco depicts the Battle at the Milvian Bridge. This is a bridge north of Rome which still exists. You can see Constantine victorious. He is the one on the white horse with a golden armor and a spear in his hands. The evil Maxentius drowns in the Tiber on his brown horse, looking at Constantine. You can also see that Constantine is protected by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, who are flying above Constantine during the battle.</p>
<figure id="attachment_256" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image178.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-256" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image178.jpg?resize=300%2C195" alt="The Baptism of Constantine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Baptism of Constantine</figcaption></figure>
<p>The next one represents the Baptism of Constantine. Constantine suffered of leprosy and his pagan advisers advised him to bathe in an innocent’s child blood. St Peter and St Paul appeared to him and told him to find Pope Sylvester I. Constantine then was baptized by the Pope and miraculously cured. This legend seems to be a fabrication however.</p>
<p>Most historians agree that if Constantine ever was baptized it was just before dying, because he believed it was impossible to be a good Emperor and a good Christian at the same time. Constantine did legalize Christianity though in the year 313 with the edict of Milan. The influence of Constantine on western history was almost unparalleled because of this. Before the Emperor started to favor Christianity about 5% of the population of the empire was Christian. After Constantine about 60% became Christian.</p>
<figure id="attachment_257" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image179.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-257" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image179.jpg?resize=300%2C195" alt="The Donation of Constantine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Donation of Constantine</figcaption></figure>
<p>The last fresco is the Donation of Constantine. For a long time it was believed that when Constantine left Rome to found Constantinople, he left his temporal power to Pope Sylvester I. The church was in possession of a document that claimed the papacy was the rightful ruler of the whole western world. For a long time Popes based their temporal power on this document. In the renaissance this document was discovered to be a forgery. The Latin used could never have been written in the time of Constantine and it was clear the document was written many centuries after the death of Constantine. On the fresco we see the Emperor kneeling before the Pope. This is pure propaganda! Emperors should kneel for Popes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This room in the Vatican is called the Room of Immaculate Conception. This room is situated on what was once the Borgia Tower. The Frescos here were painted by Francesco Podesti in the 19th century. They show scenes from the proclamation of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854.</p>
<p>The doctrine refers to the conception of the Virgin Mary in the womb of her mother Anne. According to the doctrine Anne’s womb was without sin and so the Virgin Mary was born free of original sin and therefore Christ was born free of sin. The document was proclaimed Ex Cathedra. When a dogma is proclaimed ex cathedra it can no longer be changed. This was the last time a dogma was proclaimed Ex Cathedra. The papal bull was sent to every country in the world and as was the custom the countries sent it back to the Vatican translated into their own language. These documents are kept in this beautiful cabinet which was made in Paris.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This room in the Vatican is called the king Sobieski Room and is named after the huge painting by the Polish artist Jan Matejko. It shows the victory of the king of Poland John III Sobieski, who stopped the Ottoman Turks from invading Vienna in 1683. Thanks to Sobieski Europe was not overrun by the Turks. The painting was donated to the Pope by the Artist in the 1800’s. All the other paintings in here also date back to 1800’s.</p>
<p>Next to the door is a painting of the Martyrs of Gorkum. These 19 catholic Dutch Franciscans were hanged by the Protestants on 9 July 1572 in the Dutch religious wars. They were canonized on 29 June 1865 by the Pope in Rome. The painting is by Cesare Fracassini.</p>
<p>If you look out of the window you can see a building on the other side. This is the Sistine Chapel from the outside. As you can see it was built as a fort. Look at the top of the building where you can see places where archers could shoot from.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The total territory of the Vatican is 110 acres, which is 44 hectares. Within the walls only 900 people live, 700 men and 200 women. The Vatican is of course a country. The Pope is the head of state. The Vatican City State is the only absolute monarchy left in Europe. The Vatican issues its own passport and license plates, but very few people have Vatican nationality. Often people obtain Vatican nationality for the duration of their assignment. The Vatican has their own euros but they are almost impossible to obtain. You can buy them for a lot of money in collectors’ stores. They also have TV network and radio station. Of course there are also government offices and courthouses, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Vatican has a fire department and its own military corps. This is the Swiss Guards. There are about 100 guards now, but before it was a real army. The corps was founded by Pope Julius II, who just wanted Swiss mercenaries, because at that time the Swiss were the best and most organized fighters of Europe.</p>
<p>To be a Swiss Guard you have to be between 19 and 25. You have to be Swiss. They often come from the Italian speaking part of Switzerland. You cannot have a police record, not even a parking ticket. You have to come from a good catholic home and you are not allowed to marry while you serve the Pope. They are trained in about 600 different weapons so they can pick up anything on the floor and kill you with it.</p>
<p>They live within the walls and do not pay rent or food. It is considered an honorary job. Afterwards it is very easy for them to find a job in Switzerland, because it is still highly regarded.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Gallery of the Maps was commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. It is 120 meters long. It was painted and designed by the most famous cartographers, who were led by Ignazio Danti, a famous Dominican monk. They went out and studied all of Italy and then produced these maps. They are very accurate. If you compare them with modern maps they are about 84% accurate. This is of course an amazing achievement as they did not have aerial photography or satellites.</p>
<p>There are 40 maps in this room. You have to imagine you are walking on the Apennine Mountains, so all the maps to your left represent the west side of Italy and all the maps on your right represent the east of Italy. But beware; sometimes north and south are reversed.</p>
<p><span id="more-705"></span></p>
<p>Besides Italy you will see immediately on your left a map of the area around Avignon in France, which at that time was part of the papal possessions. The maps are a valuable source of information, because many of these villages you see on the maps now have disappeared. Many villages only live on in the last name of Italians who often took their last name from the place they were from, unless they were of noble birth. So it is Leonardo da Vinci, because he was from Vinci, a small village in Tuscany.</p>
<p>In the maps you can also see some famous historical battles being depicted, like the battle of Trasimeno where Hannibal defeated the Romans.</p>
<figure id="attachment_252" style="width: 190px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image174.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-252" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image174.jpg?resize=190%2C300" alt="Ceiling of the Gallery of the Maps" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ceiling of the Gallery of the Maps</figcaption></figure>
<p>Do not forget to look at the ceilings they are breathtaking. We see 80 episodes from the history of the Catholic Church and Saints and all the stories took place in the territory beneath it.  They were painted in the 1600’s by a lot of different artists. The two lead painters were Girolamo Muziano and Cesare Nebbia.</p>
<p>In 1631 Pope Urban VIII had the maps completed and embellished with additional ornamental elements by Lucas Holste.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the left wall of the gallery of the Tapestries you can see tapestries representing the life of Christ. They are based on designs by the school of Raphael, but they were woven in Flanders, where the best weaver could be found. They were commissioned by Clement VII in the 1500’s. The ones on the right tell the life of Urban VIII. He was a Pope from the Barberini family. These tapestries were woven here in Rome and you can see the difference in quality. Clearly the Flemish weavers were a lot better at weaving.</p>
<p>It would take 9 years to finish just one tapestry. They are made out of the most precious materials like gold thread, silk, silver thread and wool. They were not only made to decorate walls but also to keep out the heat or the cold in summer or winter. They would give extra isolation. We will concentrate on the tapestries on the left because they are the most interesting.</p>
<p><span id="more-703"></span></p>
<p>The first tapestry on the left depicts the birth of Jesus.</p>
<p>The next one is more interesting because it depicts baby Jesus being circumcised by a Pope.  Of course no Popes existed back then.</p>
<p>While you pass the tapestries do not forget to look up. The ceilings look like they are carved, but they are not. They are painted. It is a technique called Chiaroscuro. The artist paints shadows to make his painting three-dimensional. They were painted in 1789 by Domenico Del Frate and Antonio Marini and depict allegorical scenes celebrating the glory of the reigning Pope, Pius VI.</p>
<p>Then there is a Transfiguration. Jesus shows his true godly nature to 3 apostles. He begins to shine with white bright light and then Moses and Elijah appear next to him. Then a voice from the sky calls him son.</p>
<p>The next three tapestries depict the massacre of the innocents. It is a depiction of a horrible story. King Herod ordered the killing of all the babies in Bethlehem because he heard from the three kings that a new king of the Jews was born there.</p>
<p>The next tapestry represents the resurrection of Christ. This is the most famous tapestry. As you walk past it you have to keep on looking into the eyes of Christ. You will see that he looks at you from every angle. This is of course symbolic. Christ watches over you. The effect is really well done. The technique was used in painting more often, like in Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, but to create the same effect in tapestry is very difficult. It involves a complex system of cross-stitching.</p>
<p>The last two tapestries on your left before you enter the next Gallery are different. They do not depict the life of Christ, but scenes from Roman times. The last one is the most interesting. Here we see the murder of Julius Caesar by 60 senators. This happened on the Ides of March in 44 BC, which is the 15th of March. The senators were afraid that Caesar wanted to become king. At that time Rome was a republic, but Caesar had been ruling as a Dictator for many years. The senators wanted Rome to stay a republic, but unfortunately for them after the murder, Caesar’s adopted son Octavian won a civil war and became the first Imperator, or Emperor and took the name Augustus. This was the end of the republic system and the start of the Roman Empire.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Galleria della Candelabra is named after the candle holders in the niches. This used to be open loggia. There was no roof here, but Michelangelo Simonetti closed it in the 18th century. Notice how the floor goes downhill and have a look at the beautiful marble floors. The ceilings were painted very late for the Vatican. They are from 1883 and were painted by Domenico Torti and Ludwig Seitz under Pope Leo XIII.</p>
<p>In this room many Popes would stay during the summer, because it is one of the few places in the Vatican where you can enjoy a nice breeze. The Vatican is very hot in the summer. That is why nowadays the Pope stays outside Rome in the summer in Castel Gandolfo.</p>
<p><span id="more-701"></span></p>
<p>This room is filled with statues but most of them are not very famous or important. They were all found buried around Rome and many have an alcoholic theme. You will see many people drinking or drunk and have something to do with the cult of Bacchus (Latin) or Dionysus (Greek), the god of wine, madness and ecstasy.</p>
<p>On your right you will see a goddess with what looks like a lot of breasts. She is Diana, or Artemis in Greek. She is the goddess of hunting and fertility. For a long time people thought she had a lot of breasts but often she is also depicted as a normal human looking god. Look to the statue facing Diana on the other side of the hall. This also is Diana but represented in a more normal fashion. We know Diana had an important cult in Ephese in Greece. The problem is the cult was secret so nothing about it ever was written down. We know it was very important but we know little about it. Nowadays some archaeologists think that they are not breasts but represent the testicles of bulls which were a symbol of male fertility.</p>
<p>The next statue is Bacchus, the God of Wine. He is carrying a little boy on his back. It is very famous because it still has the original glass eyes. Before, many statues had glass eyes. Unfortunately many of these eyes were broken when barbarians invaded. They thought the eyes were made out of precious stones, but they were just made out of glass.</p>
<p>Maybe you notice that a lot of statues are dressed in a fig leaf. This is absolutely not classical. The Romans never had any problems with nudity, or sexuality for that matter. Most private parts of the statues were taken off in the 17th and 18th century and replaced with fig leaves, because the Popes thought the statues to be to indecent to show naked.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The next room from the Round Room is called the room of the Greek cross. It was also designed by Michelangelo Simonetti in 1780. If you look behind you next to the door you can see two Egyptian statues. They are not real Egyptian, but roman fake Egyptian. They were made for Emperor Hadrian’s villa in Tivoli and that is where they were found.</p>
<p>The two sarcophagi date are from the 4th century AD and are made are porphyry, the same material as Nero’s bathtub in the last room. Look at them. One was meant for Emperor Constantine&#8217;s father and one was meant for his daughter. Which one is which do you think? Clearly the one with the angel-like figures and vines was made for his daughter and the one with the warriors on horseback was made for his father. Constantine was a very important Emperor, maybe the most influential of them all, because it was Constantine who made the empire Christian and it was Constantine who built the first Saint Peter’s Basilica.</p>
<p><span id="more-699"></span></p>
<p>The mosaic in the middle represents Pallas Athena and is from the 3rd century AD. She is the goddess of wisdom, courage and justice.</p>
<p>The two sphinxes also came from Hadrian’s villa and are not Egyptian but Roman.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This room in the Vatican Museums is the Round Room. This room was also designed by Michelangelo Simonetti designed. Does it remind you of something? Well it should. It is clearly based on the pantheon. If you have not seen the pantheon yet, please go. It is amazing. The mosaic floors dates back to the second century BC and depicts the battle of the Centaurs. They came from bathhouses in Ostia, the old port of Rome. Also these mosaics were brought here piece by piece.</p>
<p>In the center is a monolithic basin, so it is made out of one piece of porphyry. It is from the time of Emperor Nero. Maybe you remember him. He is one of the most infamous Emperors. According to legend he was responsible for the famous fire in Rome in 64 AD. Nero fiddled while Rome burnt. He used the space the fire created to build his enormous golden house. This tub belonged in that house. He famously said when he moved in; ‘Finally I can live like a human being’. This is made of red porphyry. This material was known as the Emperor’s marble, because purple was the color of the Emperors and the material at that time could only be found in a remote place in Egypt. It still is extremely expensive material.</p>
<p>Nero of course committed suicide after losing a civil war. His famous last words were: ‘Qualis artifex pereo’: What an artist dies in me. His house was afterwards torn down and the Colosseum was built on top of parts of it.</p>
<p><span id="more-697"></span></p>
<p>The statue on the right next to the door is a statue of Antinous. In this room is also a bust of the same boy, see if you can discover him, the face is exactly the same. Antinous was the lover of an Emperor. This was Emperor Hadrian, famous for building a wall to keep out the Scots in England and for building the Pantheon. Hadrian met him in Greece when Antinous was just a boy and the Emperor was 54. Antinous accompanied Hadrian on his many travels until the boy drowned in Egypt in the Nile. Hadrian was struck with grief and declared the boy a god. He then ordered statues to be made to be worshipped throughout the empire. This is way the face of Antinous is one of the best known faces from antiquity. You can see a bust a Hadrian next to the bronze statue of Hercules. You can always recognize Hadrian because he had a beard. He was the first Emperor to have a beard, which he wore according to Greek fashion.</p>
<figure id="attachment_246" style="width: 165px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image168.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-246" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image168.jpg?resize=165%2C300" alt="Hercules" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Hercules</figcaption></figure>
<p>The other very famous statue in this room is the bronze Hercules. It was found in 1864 close to Campo de’ Fiori. It is one of the very few original bronze statues left from ancient times. Many were melted down. This one survived and we know why. It was buried because it was struck by lightning. Lightning was the symbol of Jupiter, the most important god. The romans were very superstitious people so when this statue was struck they thought Jupiter does not like this statue. So they buried it deep in the ground. So thanks to Jupiter we still have this amazing bronze statue.</p>
<p>There is also a big statue of a man sitting. This was Emperor Galba. He is not a very famous Emperor, because he was only Emperor for seven months. In the civil war following Nero’s death Galba promised the Praetorian Guard (the Emperor personal army) riches if they supported him to become Emperor. Once Galba was Emperor he refused to pay up and the Praetorian Guard then murdered him.</p>
<p>The next statue is of Emperor Claudius. Claudius was one of the few family members of notorious Caligula he did not kill, because he thought his uncle was retarded. Claudius lisped and often had drool coming from his mouth and probably epileptic attacks and that is why his whole family thought he was harmless. When Caligula was murdered the Praetorian Guard proclaimed Claudius Emperor, because he promised them money and he was the only one of the imperial family still alive. Claudius turned out to be a decent Emperor and was not retarded at all. It was under Claudius Britain was conquered. You can clearly see that the Emperors were displayed as gods. It is very unlikely Claudius had a body like that of his statue.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The next room from the Octagonal Courtyard is the room of the muses. You can see the muses standing with their backs to the wall all around the room. They are meant to be seen only from the front. The room was designed by Michelangelo Simonetti (a different Michelangelo) and the ceilings were frescoed by Tommaso Conca at the end of the 18th century. The muses are seven daughters of Jupiter and they represent different arts, like song and poetry. They were found in 1774 near Tivoli, a small town near Rome.</p>
<p>The statue in the middle is very important and is called the Belvedere Torso. We do not know who it represents, but this torso was of an immense influence on the art of Michelangelo. You can clearly see how. Look at the muscles and the pose. There is a lot of tension in the body. This is a technique Michelangelo would use extensively to make statues livelier. Remember the static Roman statues you have seen before? This is something else. It is an original Greek statue as you can see by the inscription in the front. It is signed with the name Apollonius. This piece was found in the 15th century at the site of the Roman baths of Caracalla near the Circus Maximus. It is believed to be Hercules, because of the lion skin he is sitting on.</p>
<p>Now try to remember this statue, because you will be able to see it about twenty times in Michelangelo’s fresco of the Sistine chapel. There you will see a lot of naked figures, called Ignudi. He used these figures as some sort of decoration. You will be able to see that Michelangelo painted the torso belvedere from different positions with different heads and feet and managed to create 20 different naked figures like this. He also used for the body of Christ in his fresco of the last judgment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most important statue in the Octagonal Courtyard is the Laocoön Group. It dates back to the first century AD, but the original Greek bronze dated back to 2bc. The original is once again lost.  It is called a monolithic statue, because it is made from one single block of marble. It was sculpted by three artists from Rhodes.</p>
<p>It represents a Trojan Priest. Do you remember the story of the Trojan War? The Trojan prince Paris declared Venus to be the most beautiful of all goddesses and therefore she allowed him to marry the most beautiful girl in the world. Unfortunately this was Helen, the wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. Paris kidnapped her and took her to Troy and so the Greek started a war. This war lasted for ten years and was only decided by a trick by Odysseus, a famous Greek hero.</p>
<p><span id="more-691"></span></p>
<p>One morning the Greek left the beach where they were based and just left an enormous wooden horse in front of the gate of Troy. Of course the Trojans did not know what to do with this horse. What would you do if you woke up one morning and a wooden horse was standing in your doorstep? So they debated and one priest did not like the horse. He had a premonition. He warned the Trojans not to take in the horse. But then to snakes came from the sea and devoured him and his sons. The Trojans thought this meant the gods wanted them to take in the horse. So they did and in the night the Greek warriors came out of the belly of the horse, opened the city gate and Troy was destroyed.</p>
<p>It is an amazing statue. You can see fear and pain in their expressions. Even in antiquity this was a very famous piece. It was lost for many years but then it was found again in 1506 on Esquiline hill. Pope Julius II bought it immediately and brought it here. The right arm of the statue was missing so Michelangelo made a new one. Then centuries later, in 1905, the original arm was found in an antique shop. You can still see Michelangelo’s arm in the photo in front of the statue.</p>
<p>After this statue was found, it had an enormous influence on later artists. You can notice, looking at other statues in this courtyard, that there is a lot more emotion and movement in this statue. So centuries after it was made it was a major influence on the development of baroque sculpture.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a very important piece in the Octagonal courtyard. Many renaissance and baroque artists used this statue in their own work. Look at the face of Apollo. Later when you will be in the Sistine chapel you will see this face again. Michelangelo copied this face to use for his Jesus figure in his fresco of the last judgment. Look closely so you will remember. He thought the face was one of perfect male beauty and that is why he used it.</p>
<p>The statue is called Apollo Belvedere. Apollo was the sun-god and the god of reason and arts. He was second only to Zeus. In one hand he has a bow and the other an arrow, because the romans believed that if a person suddenly dropped dead he was struck down by one of Apollo’s arrows. Now of course we know this can caused by a heart attack for example.</p>
<p>These pieces date back to the 2nd century AD, but it is a copy of a lost Greek bronze from the 4th century BC. It is roman made. We can see this because the roman sculptors were not as good as the Greek ones, so for example this one needs a little tree trunk to keep standing.</p>
<p>This piece was taken by Napoleon to Paris in 1797 and later returned in 1815 after the battle of the Waterloo. Gian Lorenzo Bernini was also inspired by this statue and used it in his Apollo and Daphne, the amazing statue that is now in the Galleria Borghese.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These statues are all neo-classical pieces by Antonio Canova made in the 1800’s. When Napoleon conquered Italy his troops stole the famous ancient statues from the octagonal courtyard and took them to Paris. To replace them, this statue was put here, a masterpiece by Antonio Canova. It represents the story of the medusa. The medusa was a monster. She was a woman with snakes for hair. If you would look into her eyes you would turn into stone. Many warriors and heroes had come and tried to kill her but all had been turned into stone. Then came the Greek hero Perseus. He was smart. He never looked for medusa but instead looked into the reflection of his sword. This way he could see where she was and like this he managed to cut off her head.</p>
<p><span id="more-687"></span></p>
<p>The boxers in front of them are Kreugas and Damoxenos, also by Antonio Canova. During a match Damoxenos stabbed Kreugas and pulled out his intestines so he was automatically disqualified and the dead Kreugas was named the winner.</p>
<p>After Napoleon was conquered Antonio Canova was sent to Paris as an ambassador to try to get the stolen statues back. He managed to get them back and as a reward his own statue was allowed to remain in the octagonal courtyard which was an enormous honor.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just before entering the Octagonal Courtyard you see this statue. This is the Apoxyomenos. It is a roman copy of a very famous lost statue by the Greek sculptor Lysippos. Often we only have roman marble copies of Greek statues left, because the bronze statues were often melted down to make cannonballs for example. This artist worked at the court of Alexander the Great. The fun thing about this statue is that it explains nicely how an athlete would clean himself after a wrestling match. In ancient time wrestlers would often put oil all over their body as a form of protection and to make them slippery. After the match the athlete would use an artifact to scrape of the oil and sweat from his body. This is a very good way to clean yourself as the oil extracts all the dirt and sweat from your pores. Romans used this method as well in the bath-houses to clean themselves. A friend or slave would rub you in with oil and then you would scrape it off. This way you get much cleaner than just taking a shower.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the Octagonal courtyard; It was here the Vatican museums started. Julius II put the statue of the Laocoön and other ancient statues that he bought here for the public to see. The courtyard was transformed into an octagonal space in the 1700’s by Michelangelo Simonetti.</p>
<p>In this courtyard artists like Michelangelo, Raphael and Bernini sat down and studied the ancient sculptures. You must realize that at that time there were not so many known ancient sculptures. The collection of the Pope was very small. It was only later that most of the statues you have seen and will see were discovered. So the famous statues Michelangelo and Bernini studied were all found here.</p>
<p><span id="more-682"></span></p>
<p>Besides the statues we also see a lot of sarcophagi and bathtubs from ancient times. The bathtubs are made of marble or granite because these materials keep cool and in the summer it’s very hot here in Rome. You can feel them and notice how cool the rock is. They were brought here from ancient Roman baths around Rome. It is not known who the sarcophagi belonged to.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are now standing in the Cortile della Pigna, It is of course named after that big bronze pine cone that used to stand somewhere in the medieval city before it was moved here. It dates back the 2nd century AD and was used as a water fountain (see the difference in color on the top). The base below it came from the ancient Roman baths of Septimus Severus and dates back to 2ad as well.</p>
<p>The 2 peacocks on the sides came from Hadrian’s Villa in Tivoli (a very nice place for a day trip) they also date back to the 2nd century. Peacocks always represent immortality, because it was believed that the flesh from the peacock did not rot after death. This courtyard was used for parties and receptions. In the time of the Borgia Pope (Alexander VI)bullfights were held here. Once an Elephant lived here as well (he was a gift to the Pope).</p>
<p><span id="more-679"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_236" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image159.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-236" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image159.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="The Globe in the Cortile della Pigna" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Globe in the Cortile della Pigna</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the middle of the courtyard, you can see an enormous Globe. It was a gift to John Paul II in 1990 from a famous Italian artist named Arnaldo Pomodoro, which means tomato in Italian. It has two spheres. It is said it represents the Vatican as its own world inside the rest of the world. Both spheres were able to move, but the inside one is broken now and is stuck and cannot be fixed without destroying the whole thing.</p>
<p>On the courtyard you can also see an enormous head. This is an ancient statue of the first Emperor Augustus. The hair was added in the 17th century. This was often done in those times. If a statue was found missing something they just hired an artist to complete it. So in this museum often you will see an ancient statue with a new nose or new hairdo. This one is a bit extreme because this hair is obviously nothing like Augustus’ hair.</p>
<figure id="attachment_237" style="width: 200px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image160.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-237" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image160.jpg?resize=200%2C300" alt="Ancient Statues" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ancient Statues</figcaption></figure>
<p>When you continue your visit on the other side of the courtyard you will see a huge collection of ancient busts and statues. They mostly represent Emperors, noblemen like senators and gods. They were all found around Rome and are heavily restored. You can walk through the gallery to have a look if you want, but the most important statues are located to your left. Look at the decoration next to the stairs in the picture above.</p>
<p>This style of fresco painting has a very famous name. This style became popular at the end of the 15th century. A boy was walking on Esquiline hill and suddenly fell in a hole. He found himself in a strange cave (grotto in Italian) filled with beautiful frescos. It later turned out that the caves once were Emperor Nero’s golden house. The style of wall decoration found in the caves became very popular and the style became known as Grotesque, from the Italian grotto for cave.</p>
<p>On top of the stairs you will see a basin and if you look to your right out the window you will have a nice view of Rome. From here you can see the dome of the pantheon if you look closely and further away the mountains of the Castelli Romani where the Pope has his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo. The palace there is also Vatican territory.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Paul II created this new entrance because the old entrance was not suitable to accommodate all the tourists. On average 15,000 people enter the museums. Also, since an attack on the Pietà, the famous statue by Michelangelo in Saint Peters, security had to be improved. So that is way you had to pass the scanners at the entrance.</p>
<p>When you arrive at the top of the escalators, the main museum is up the small stairs to your left, but I can advise you to first go straight into the little courtyard where you have an amazing view of the dome of Saint Peters, an amazing design by Michelangelo.</p>
<p>Even though Michelangelo was considered himself to be a sculptor, he had the capacity to become amazingly good at something in a very short time. So it was only later in his long life that Michelangelo started doing architecture. Michelangelo re-designed the dome in 1547, when he was 72 years old (He died when he was 88 years old), and came up with this amazing design. It is the tallest dome in the world with a height of 136.57 meters. Its diameter is just a little bit shorter than that of the pantheon, because Michelangelo wanted to honor the unknown ancient architect of that building. It is also a bit smaller than the dome in Florence in honor of the architect Filippo Brunelleschi, who was the first man who managed to build an enormous dome, something which no architect had managed since classical times. Michelangelo said himself that although his dome was higher, the one in Florence was more beautiful.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I always love to quote Mark Twain when talking about the Vatican Museums. In ‘Innocents Abroad’ he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this connection I wish to say one word about Michelangelo Buonarroti. I used to worship the mighty genius of Michelangelo&#8211;that man who was great in poetry, painting, sculpture, architecture&#8211;great in everything he undertook. But I do not want Michelangelo for breakfast&#8211; for luncheon &#8212; for dinner&#8211;for tea&#8211;for supper&#8211;for between meals. I like a change, occasionally. In Genoa, he designed everything; in Milan he or his pupils designed everything; he designed the Lake of Como; in Padua, Verona, Venice, Bologna, who did we ever hear of, from guides, but Michael Angelo? In Florence, he painted everything, designed everything, nearly, and what he did not design he used to sit on a favorite stone and look at, and they showed us the stone.</p>
<p>In Pisa he designed everything but the old shot-tower, and they would have attributed that to him if it had not been so awfully out of the perpendicular. He designed the piers of Leghorn and the custom house regulations of Civita Vecchia. But, here&#8211;here it is frightful. He designed St. Peter&#8217;s; he designed the Pope; he designed the Pantheon, the uniform of the Pope&#8217;s soldiers, the Tiber, the Vatican, the Colosseum, the Capitol, the Tarpeian Rock, the Barberini Palace, St. John Lateran, the Campagna, the Appian Way, the Seven Hills, the Baths of Caracalla, the Claudian Aqueduct, the Cloaca Maxima&#8211;the eternal bore designed the Eternal City, and unless all men and books do lie, he painted everything in it!</p>
<p>I never felt so fervently thankful, so soothed, so tranquil, so filled with a blessed peace, as I did yesterday when I learned that Michelangelo was dead.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you look to the floor at the left nave of Saint Peter&#8217;s, you can see the coat of arms of John Paul II. He designed this himself. Before, Popes were of noble decent and so had a coat-of-arms. The modern Popes are no longer from the nobility so they design their own coat-of-arms. John Paul used the colors of the Vatican flag, the M for Mary, because he dedicated his papacy to the Virgin Mary, who always had inspired him. Then you can see the words Totus Tuus means totally yours. PM stands for Pontifex Maximus, an old Roman title for the highest priest which the Popes took over.</p>
<p>Close to it you can see the monument to James III. He was the last of the Stuarts, the family that ruled England for many years. This monument is made by Antonio Canova, the same artist that did Perseus with the head of Medusa in the Vatican museums. This family was expelled from England, because they did not want to give up their Catholic faith. They took refuge in Rome 1689. His wife also got a monument in front of him. This is a neo-classical artwork, which makes it stand out in the church, because most of the interior is Baroque.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Saint Peter&#8217;s Basilica, you can see a copy of a painting that now hangs inside the Vatican Museum. This is a mosaic; if you look closely you can see it is made out of a lot of tiny stones. It&#8217;s a Mosaic of the Transfiguration by Raphael. This was his last work; he was very ill when he painted it and knew he was dying. He asked his friends to carry this painting to the Pantheon on the day of his funeral, because he loved this painting so much. It is indeed one of his masterpieces. If you have the time, go and see it as well in the Vatican Museums, because the real thing is much more impressive.</p>
<p>It of course represents the Transfiguration. This is when Christ showed his true godly nature to Saint John, Saint Peter and Saint James. He starts flying and Elijah and Moses appear next to him in the sky. The apostles fall down, blinded by the light.</p>
<p><span id="more-653"></span></p>
<p>Below all those people are in a state of confusion. Some apostles are trying to cure a possessed boy, which they cannot do. Only the transfigured Christ, later, will save the boy.</p>
<p>Raphael’s love of his life was a baker’s daughter. He was never allowed to marry her, because she was too poor. In Italian she is called La Fornarina. She appears in many of his paintings. Here we see her in pink and blue on the foreground. When Raphael died she entered a monastery.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This beautiful and extravagant Funerary Monument to Alexander XII was designed by Bernini when he was very old, at the age of 80. He did work on it, with the help of his students. When Bernini got the commission he had one problem. There was a door in the place the monument was supposed to stand. So Bernini, very cleverly, used the door in his composition. How did he do it? You can see a skeleton coming from under the big cloth, with his hands up. In his hands he holds an hourglass, saying Alexander’s time has come. The cloth represents the cloth of death which covers everything and the door of course symbolizes the passage to the next life.</p>
<p>There are also the female figures which represent the four virtues of the Pope: Justice, Prudence, Charity and Truth. Take a good look at Truth; she has her foot over a globe. Bernini decided to make Italy very big, because Rome of course was the center of the world. Under Truth’s big toe you can see a horn coming from England. This refers to the problem the Church had VIII, who wanted a divorce from his wife which the Pope refused to grant. Henry then decided to form his own Church.</p>
