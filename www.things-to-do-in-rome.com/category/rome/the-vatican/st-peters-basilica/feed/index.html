				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you look to the floor at the left nave of Saint Peter&#8217;s, you can see the coat of arms of John Paul II. He designed this himself. Before, Popes were of noble decent and so had a coat-of-arms. The modern Popes are no longer from the nobility so they design their own coat-of-arms. John Paul used the colors of the Vatican flag, the M for Mary, because he dedicated his papacy to the Virgin Mary, who always had inspired him. Then you can see the words Totus Tuus means totally yours. PM stands for Pontifex Maximus, an old Roman title for the highest priest which the Popes took over.</p>
<p>Close to it you can see the monument to James III. He was the last of the Stuarts, the family that ruled England for many years. This monument is made by Antonio Canova, the same artist that did Perseus with the head of Medusa in the Vatican museums. This family was expelled from England, because they did not want to give up their Catholic faith. They took refuge in Rome 1689. His wife also got a monument in front of him. This is a neo-classical artwork, which makes it stand out in the church, because most of the interior is Baroque.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Saint Peter&#8217;s Basilica, you can see a copy of a painting that now hangs inside the Vatican Museum. This is a mosaic; if you look closely you can see it is made out of a lot of tiny stones. It&#8217;s a Mosaic of the Transfiguration by Raphael. This was his last work; he was very ill when he painted it and knew he was dying. He asked his friends to carry this painting to the Pantheon on the day of his funeral, because he loved this painting so much. It is indeed one of his masterpieces. If you have the time, go and see it as well in the Vatican Museums, because the real thing is much more impressive.</p>
<p>It of course represents the Transfiguration. This is when Christ showed his true godly nature to Saint John, Saint Peter and Saint James. He starts flying and Elijah and Moses appear next to him in the sky. The apostles fall down, blinded by the light.</p>
<p><span id="more-653"></span></p>
<p>Below all those people are in a state of confusion. Some apostles are trying to cure a possessed boy, which they cannot do. Only the transfigured Christ, later, will save the boy.</p>
<p>Raphael’s love of his life was a baker’s daughter. He was never allowed to marry her, because she was too poor. In Italian she is called La Fornarina. She appears in many of his paintings. Here we see her in pink and blue on the foreground. When Raphael died she entered a monastery.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This beautiful and extravagant Funerary Monument to Alexander XII was designed by Bernini when he was very old, at the age of 80. He did work on it, with the help of his students. When Bernini got the commission he had one problem. There was a door in the place the monument was supposed to stand. So Bernini, very cleverly, used the door in his composition. How did he do it? You can see a skeleton coming from under the big cloth, with his hands up. In his hands he holds an hourglass, saying Alexander’s time has come. The cloth represents the cloth of death which covers everything and the door of course symbolizes the passage to the next life.</p>
<p>There are also the female figures which represent the four virtues of the Pope: Justice, Prudence, Charity and Truth. Take a good look at Truth; she has her foot over a globe. Bernini decided to make Italy very big, because Rome of course was the center of the world. Under Truth’s big toe you can see a horn coming from England. This refers to the problem the Church had VIII, who wanted a divorce from his wife which the Pope refused to grant. Henry then decided to form his own Church.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Cathedra Petri, at the back of Saint Peter&#8217;s was also made by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. To give you an idea of the dimensions, the wingspan of the dove is almost 2 meters or a little over 6 foot. The windows are made of alabaster. This is a stone which you would get if you compressed marble for millions of years. It has an interesting quality. It lets light through, which is why it was used here. It represents the light of the Holy Spirit. Next to the alabaster windows you can see small figures that become bigger the further they get from the window. Bernini wants to say here that all beings originate from the light of God.</p>
<p>Below you can see the seat of Saint Peter. It is being held up by four Church fathers. According to legend pieces of Saint Peter’s chair was used to create this bronze chair, but we now know this chair was probably a gift from an early French King. This chair was already in the old Basilica and had to get a new spot in the new one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last statue under the dome of St. Peter&#8217;s is Saint Andrew, Patron Saint of Scotland and Greece. He was Peter’s brother and went to Greece to spread the Christian faith. He cured the Roman Governor’s wife of a serious illness and converted her to Christianity, but it is said that he persuaded her to also deny her husband his marital rights, which is what got him beheaded, not his preaching. The head however is no longer here, a treaty was signed in 1966 with the Greek Orthodox Church and as a token of good will the head was sent back to Greece.</p>

She saw Christ fall for the third time when he was carrying his cross up the hill and stepped forward to wipe his face with her veil. An image of Christ’s face remained on the fabric. We do not know her real name, but she was named Veronica, because <em>Vero</em> means true and <em>Nica</em> means icon, so her name means true icon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around the baldacchino in St. Peter&#8217;s are four sculptures in the pillars that support the Dome. Relics of these four Saints are kept inside the pillars. The first we see is Saint Longinus, which was sculpted by Bernini. He is the Roman soldier that put his spear in the side of Christ when he was on the cross. Right when Longinus did this he was struck by light and realized Christ was truly God’s son. He then converted and became a Saint. We see him here just after he realized Christ was truly God’s son. He is struck by light, and of course here the light is also present. It comes from the dome above him. The original spear was donated to the Vatican and it’s kept in above the statue, behind the doors on the balcony.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Baldacchino, the structure which covers the altar, is made of bronze and was designed by Bernini, for Pope Urban VIII from the Barberini family. If you look closely you can see small bees everywhere on the building. This is because the Barberini coat-of-arms consists of three bees. Bernini was only 26 years old at the time and it is an incredible and famous work. When it was built they needed bronze, so the Pope ordered for the bronze to be taken from the roof of the Pantheon. This is why there is a saying in Rome that says “what the barbarians didn’t do, the Barberini did). It weighs 120 tons and it took almost 10 years to build. The baldacchino represents heaven.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you look up in the middle of Saint Peter&#8217;s, you can see Michelangelo’s dome. It is a beautiful piece of architecture. His idea was to make a dome like the Pantheon’s, but lift it up on pillars, and that is exactly what we see. He himself thought the dome of his native Florence was more beautiful and he made the diameter of his dome half a meter shorter than that of the Pantheon, in honor of the unknown architect of that building. The word around the dome say in Latin ‘Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam et tibi dabo claves regni caelorum‘: You are Peter and upon this rock I will build My Church and I will give you the keys to heaven’, the famous sentence Jesus said and on which the Popes base their authority as successors of Saint Peter, who of course is considered the first Pope. The dome weighs 56 million kilograms and is 136.5 meter high, which is 447.8 feet. You can climb the dome. The entrance is outside the Church on the right side, looking from the square.</p>
<p><span id="more-633"></span></p>
<p>Under the dome we can see the Confessio and the Papal altar. The confessio is where Saint Peter is buried. You cannot see his grave from here, but it is supposed to be behind the niche in the back, right under the dome. The Pallium is kept here. This is a circular band of white wool which the Pope places on the shoulders of each newly appointed Archbishop on June 29, the feast of Saint Peter and Paul. The wool comes from sheep that are blessed by the Pope on the day of Saint Agnes. Above is the Papal Altar, which only the Pope may use. It is one piece of marble that came from Roman times. From here, the Pope says mass only twice a year, on Christmas and Easter. These oil candles are always lit in honor of St Peter.</p>

This statue came from the old Saint Peter’s and was made by Arnolfo di Cambio around 1300. You can see Peter’s foot has almost disappeared from all the touching. Every year, on the day of Saint Peter and Paul, the statue is dressed up in Papal robes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a few Popes buried on this level of the church. The other 147 are buried below in the crypt, which you can visit, and also see through the openings in the floor on this level. The most famous Popes that are buried in the church itself are John XXIII who died 1963 and soon they found out his body was not decomposing. This was seen as a miracle. You can see him in a glass coffin, covered in wax. Here you can see his body in a glass coffin, covered in wax. He was very famous because of the Church Council that took place during his Papacy, Vatican II.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the right side of Saint Peter&#8217;s Basilica you can see something new. The body of Pope John Paul II was transferred here recently after he was blessed. He now is one of the few Popes that are buried inside the Basilica and not in the crypts below.</p>
<p>Close to the grave you find the entrance to the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament</p>
<p>This is the only place in the Basilica where you can pray in silence. Inside you are not allowed to take pictures. The altar inside was designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the famous baroque sculptor.</p>
<p>Also near here is the funerary monument for Pope Gregory XIII. He is the one who commissioned the gallery of the maps inside the Vatican Museums. He founded the Astrology department at the Vatican and is still famous for giving us the Gregorian calendar, the calendar we still use today. Before this they used the Julian calendar, which Julius Caesar had introduced. This calendar was wrong, because every year was 11 minutes too short, so after a lot of years, the calendar was evidently wrong. Gregory had a team of specialists create a new, correct calendar.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little bit further you can see the monument in honor of Christina of Sweden. She was a protestant queen who became Catholic and had to give up her throne and moved to Rome when she was 29 years old in 1655. It was very good Propaganda for the Catholic Church at the time, that is why she is here. She was quite a character and caused many problems for the Pope. She used to wear men’s clothes and was only 1.50 meters high. The love of her life was a cardinal in Rome, Azzolino.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This statue is one of the most famous in the world. It is la Pietà by Michelangelo. Pietà means pity or sorrow. Michelangelo was only 23 years old and it took him one year to sculpt. It is the only artwork by the artist that is signed. If you look at the ribbon across Maria’s chest you can see his name. It says Michelangelo Buanorotte Florentino ha fatto questo, Michelangelo Buonarotti from Florence has made this. He signed this work, because one day he was looking at his statue and some people came in and said the statue was made by a different sculptor. Michelangelo got angry and chiseled his name in at night.</p>
<p>Michelangelo has been criticized for this work as well. Critics say that if Maria would stand up, she would be twice as big as Christ. Also, some considered Maria to be way too youthful. She looks younger than her son. The reason Maria looks big, is because nowadays the statue stands in the wrong position. Michelangelo created it thinking it would stand on ground level. So you would look at the statue from above. If you look at the statue like that, suddenly the perspective works. The same applies to the David in Florence. People criticize this statue because its hands, feet and head are too big for its body. This is because the statue was meant to stand on the Cathedral, far up. People would only be able to see it from far, so he made the hands and feet bigger so you can notice them.</p>
<p><span id="more-619"></span></p>
<p>In 1972 a crazy person came in the church and screamed “I am Jesus and this is not my mother”. He destroyed some parts of the statue with a hammer and broke her nose. Some tourists took pieces with them as a souvenir. The man was arrested and put in the Vatican jail cell, the last person to have been in a Vatican jail. Ever since security is very strict. The statue is now behind bulletproof glass, which is a shame, because you cannot see it from up close.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you enter under the balcony you will first end up in a hall. Here, on the far left and right sides you can see two statues. On the left side you can see a statue of Charlemagne, who was crowned by the Pope in the church in the year 800. On the right side is a more beautiful statue, made by Bernini. It is Constantine, the first Christian Emperor and the founder of the first Saint Peter’s Basilica. Here we see the vision of Constantine. He is sitting on his horse and looking up. In the sky he sees the sign of the cross. The next day we would make his soldiers paint this sign on their shields and they would go on to win the battle of the Milvian Bridge which would make Constantine Emperor. After this he started to sponsor Christianity. The main doors in the middle come from the old basilica. Inside there are 44 altars, 11 domes, 778 columns, 135 mosaic paintings and 395 statues. The church is 192 meters long. It is the largest church in the world and they have markings to prove it. In the middle of the church the names and lengths of other churches can be seen. This is why the middle section is blocked, so that people stop walking over the markings.</p>
<p><span id="more-616"></span></p>
<p>The doors on the right are the Holy Doors. They are opened only every 25 years in a Jubilee year, a Holy year. This If you look at them from the inside you will see the entrance is closed with bricks. This tradition was started by Alexander VI, the Borgia Pope. The last time they were opened was in the year 2000 by Pope John Paul II. They are made of bronze. The opening of the doors always takes place on Christmas eve. The Pope knocks on the doors with a silver hammer and they open up. He is he first to go through and followed by rest of clergy and pilgrims. This happens in all the mayor Basilica’s of Rome. Santa Maria Maggiore, Saint John Lateran and Saint Paul outside the walls all have holy doors. They symbolize the entrance to heaven and if you pass through your sins are supposedly forgiven. After the Holy year the doors are closed with bricks again.</p>
<p>Enter the main door go straight to the left where you will see a red circle on the floor. The circle we are standing on is made of porphyry, the same expensive stone from which Nero’s bathtub in the Vatican museums is made. On this spot, but a few meters below, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by the Pope on Christmas eve in the year 800. Mother Teresa, Queen Elizabeth, Lady Diana and even George Clooney have all stood here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the heart of Catholicism, Saint Peter’s Basilica. If you enter the church for the first time you might need some time to get accustomed to the sheer size of the church and its decorations. Don’t worry, it is normal. Just move away from the masses and let it sink in for a bit.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a bit about the history of this site. Do you know what this site was before St. Peter&#8217;s Basilica was built? It was Caligula’s Circus, which was later enlarged by Nero. Nero reigned from 54AD to 68AD and during his reign there was a great fire in 64AD. Nero had to blame somebody for the fire, because some people said he started it himself to make room for his new Golden Palace, the Domus Aurea. So Nero blamed the Christians, which was considered a new strange sect and told them that the Roman Gods were angry at them for worshiping only one God.</p>
<p><span id="more-614"></span></p>
<p>Nero was the first to persecute Christians. Saint Peter died during these persecutions. Peter had heard people wanted to arrest him so he left Rome, but just as he had left the city gates and was walking down Via Appia he came across Jesus who was walking the other way. Peter then famously said ‘Quo Vadis Domine’, where are you going my Lord. Jesus then replied that he was going back to Rome to be crucified again. Peter then knew that his time had come and he had to go back to Rome and die for his faith. He was arrested and then crucified in Nero’s Circus. Peter asked to be crucified upside down, because he thought he was not worthy to be crucified the same way as Jesus. Peter was then buried in a small necropolis next to the circus and over time this became a place for worship for the increasing number of Christians in the city.</p>
<p>Then Emperor Constantine decided to become Christian. He soon after ordered the building of Saint Peters Basilica. The building was built on the site of Saint Peters burial place. Construction was started in 324. The Basilica was consecrated in 326.</p>
<p>Of course the building you see today is not that building. Saint Peters was rebuilt in the 16th century in a renaissance and Baroque style. It was Pope Julius II who ordered that the old Basilica had to be torn down and a new one be built in 1506. He commissioned the famous renaissance architect Donato Bramante to design a new church. Of course both Julius II and Bramante died during the same decade and so the plan changed quite a few times (some of the architects that were involved were Raphael and Antonio da Sangallo) until in 1546 Michelangelo who was now 70 years old was assigned as the main architect for the Basilica. Michelangelo did not get paid for his work; he did it for the glory of the work and for his own salvation. He died at the age of 88 and work on the dome ceased for 24 years. It was finally finished in 22 months by Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana.</p>
<p>The original plan was for a church with a Greek cross floor plan, instead of a Latin cross, but in 1600 Pope Paul V commissioned Carlo Maderna to change the floor plan into a Latin cross. This way the church became much bigger than originally intended. Carlo Maderna is also responsible for the facade of the church and for the fountain on the right side of the piazza. Bernini added the other fountain to make it more symmetrical. Students of Bernini added the sculptures on top of the facade. You can see Christ in the middle and 10 apostles, replacing Judas with John the Baptist.</p>
<p>Paulus V added the text on the facade &#8216;In Honorem Principis Apost. &#8211; Paulus v Burghesius Romanus Pont. Max. Anno MDCXII &#8211; Pont. VII&#8217; which means In honor of the prince of apostles, Pontifex Maximus Paul V of the Borghese family made this in the year 1612. The letters are 2 meters high.</p>
<p>It took 120 years to build the Church; Most of the material is marble, granite and travertine. Some of it came from Colosseum and Forum, where it was taken from ancient buildings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know what this site was before St. Peter&#8217;s Basilica was built?  It was the Roman Emperor Caligula’s Circus, which was later enlarged by Nero. Nero reigned from 54AD to 68AD and during his reign there was a great fire in 64AD. A big part of Rome was turned into ashes. Fires were an enormous problem in that time. Fire departments did not exist. If a fire broke out, Romans would just tear down the buildings around the fire, to make sure it would not spread. Nero had to blame somebody for the fire, because some people said he started it himself to make room for his new Golden Palace, the Domus Aurea. So Nero blamed the Christians, which was considered a new strange sect and told them that the Roman Gods were angry at them for worshiping only one God.</p>

Peter then knew that his time had come and he had to go back to Rome and die for his faith. He was arrested and then crucified in Nero’s Circus. Peter asked to be crucified upside down, because he thought he was not worthy to be crucified the same way as Jesus. Peter was then buried in a small necropolis next to the circus and over time this became a place for worship for the increasing number of Christians in the city. Centuries later things changed quite radically. Emperor Constantine decided to become Christian. Historians do not agree if he was ever baptized, but it is a fact Constantine favored Christianity. He attributed a very important battle victory to the support of the Christian God. Some historians think he wanted to use this new religion to keep the Roman Empire together.</p>
<p>He soon ordered the building of Saint Peters Basilica. The building was built on the site of Saint Peters burial place. Construction was started in 324. The Basilica was consecrated in 326.  Of course the building you see today is not that building. Saint Peters was rebuilt in the 16th century in a renaissance and Baroque style. It was Pope Julius II who ordered that the old Basilica had to be torn down and a new one be built in 1506. He commissioned the famous renaissance architect Donato Bramante to design a new church. Both Julius II and Bramante died during the same decade and so the plan changed quite a few times (some of the architects that were involved were Raphael and Antonio da Sangallo) until in 1546 Michelangelo who was 70 years old was assigned as the main architect for the Basilica. Michelangelo did not get paid for his work; he did it for the glory of the work and for his own salvation. He died at the age of 88 and work on the dome ceased for 24 years.</p>
<p>It was finally finished in 22 months by Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana. The original plan was for a church with a Greek cross floor plan, instead of a Latin cross, but in 1600 Pope Paul V commissioned Carlo Maderno to change the floor plan into a Latin cross. This way the church became much bigger than originally intended. Carlo Maderno is also responsible for the facade of the church and for the fountain on the right side of the piazza. Bernini added the other fountain to make it more symmetrical. Students of Bernini added the sculptures on top of the facade. You can see Christ in the middle and 10 apostles, replacing Judas with John the Baptist. Paulus V added the text on the facade &#8216;In Honorem Principis Apost. &#8211; Paulus v Burghesius Romanus Pont. Max. Anno MDCXII &#8211; Pont. VII&#8217; which means &#8216;in honor of the prince of apostles, Pontifex Maximus Paul V of the Borghese family made this in the year 1612&#8242;. The letters are 2 meters high It took 120 years to build the Church; Most of the material is marble, granite and travertine. Some of it came from Colosseum and Forum, where it was taken from ancient buildings. You can read more about the interior of the Church in the Chapter about Saint Peter’s Basilica.</p>
