				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The St. Paul outside the Walls or San Paolo fuori le Mura, is one of the four Papal basilicas in Rome. It was founded by Emperor Constantine to mark the grave of the apostle. It was expanded and enlarged in the following centuries, until it became even bigger than the old Saint Peter’s. The current Saint Peter’s Basilica of course is bigger. It is called outside the walls, because the grave of the apostle was outside of the city walls of Rome. Saint Paul was martyred using a sword. This was his right, because he was a Roman citizen. Jesus and Peter were not so they were crucified. Paul is almost always depicted with a sword in his hands.</p>
<p><span id="more-753"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_334" style="width: 465px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image252.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-334" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image252.jpg?resize=465%2C750" alt="Saint Paul" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Saint Paul</figcaption></figure>
<p>In front of the church you can see Saint Paul, holding a sword in his hands. He stands in a portico that is a neoclassical addition to the church.</p>
<h2>The doors of Saint Paul outside the Walls</h2>
<figure id="attachment_335" style="width: 418px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image253.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-335" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image253.jpg?resize=418%2C557" alt="The doors of Saint Paul outside the Walls" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The doors of Saint Paul outside the Walls</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_336" style="width: 404px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image254.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-336" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image254.jpg?resize=404%2C572" alt="The Holy Door" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Holy Door</figcaption></figure>
<p>The door of the church is from the 20th century. This church has also a Holy door, on the right side. This door is only opened during a Jubilee Year, which takes place every 25 years. The Jubilee year was instituted by the Borgia Pope Alexander VI, to make some extra money, but it was such a success that it was repeated every 25 years afterwards.</p>
<h2><em>The Interior of Saint Paul</em></h2>
<figure id="attachment_337" style="width: 624px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image255.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-337" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image255.jpg?resize=624%2C533" alt="The Interior of Saint Paul" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Interior of Saint Paul</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 1823 a fire started because of the negligence of a workman who was repairing the roof. The basilica was almost completely destroyed. Afterwards it was completely restored, so the current building dates from the 19th century. The new basilica has maintained its original structure with one nave and four aisles. It is the second largest church in Rome.</p>
<p>All around you can see the portraits of all the Popes, starting with Saint Peter and ending with Benedict XVI. There are only a few empty spots left and no one knows what to do if they are full.</p>
<h2>The Apse of Saint Paul</h2>
<figure id="attachment_338" style="width: 624px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image256.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-338" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image256.jpg?resize=624%2C468" alt="The Apse of Saint Paul" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Apse of Saint Paul</figcaption></figure>
<p>The apse and the triumphal arch are the only things left from the original basilica, the rest is 19th century. The 5th century mosaics on the Triumphal arch are original, the rest is a reconstruction.</p>
<figure id="attachment_339" style="width: 623px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image257.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-339" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image257.jpg?resize=623%2C428" alt="The cloister of Saint Paul" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The cloister of Saint Paul</figcaption></figure>
<p>South of the transept is the cloister, considered one of the most beautiful of the middle ages. It has double columns of different shapes, some with glass mosaic.</p>
<p>According to tradition, the church was built on top of the grave of Saint Paul, but nobody knew for sure. In 2006, Vatican archaeologists announced the discovery of a white sarcophagus below the main altar. In 2009 Pope Benedict announced that the skeleton inside had been carbon dated and came from the 1th or 2nd century AD. This seemed to confirm that the bones in the sarcophagus are actually Saint Paul’s. His head is kept in Saint John of Lateran though.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Santa Maria in Trastevere is the first church that was dedicated to Maria and according to locals the first church where Christians held public mass. The first Christians came from the Jewish community, who lived in Trastevere. The current church dates from 1140 and was built with stones from the baths of Caracalla. The mosaic on the facade is from also from that time. We see Mary on a throne surrounded by five female figures that hold small lamps. A burning flame means they are virgins, if there is no flame they are widows. Mary gives milk to baby Jesus using a small milk bottle. A bottle was used because people thought a naked breast would not be proper to put on the facade of a church.</p>
<p><span id="more-745"></span></p>
<h2>Portico</h2>
<p>In the portico you can see all sorts of Roman inscriptions. Most of them come from Christian graves. Marcus Cocceius for example explains to us on his grave that he had been married for 45 years and 11 days without fighting a single day.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The form of the church is that of an antique basilica. A basilica used to be a courtroom in Roman times, and the early Christians used this type of building to build their first churches. This is because a basilica was much more adept to hold mass than a pagan temple. It is a rectangular building. The columns were stolen from pagan temples and you can see that they are all different.</p>
<h2>Saint Antony of Padua</h2>
<p>On the left there is a statue of Saint Antony of Padua with a small baby Jesus on his arm. People believe this statue performs miracles, so there are many pleas written on small pieces of paper next to its base.</p>
<h2>Apse Mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere</h2>
<figure id="attachment_316" style="width: 602px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image235.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-316" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image235.jpg?resize=602%2C603" alt="Apse Mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Apse Mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the apse you can see a beautiful mosaic from the 12th and 13th century. Jesus sits together with Mary on a throne. Lambs walk from Bethlehem on the right and Jerusalem on the left towards the Lamb of God. Also, scenes from the life of Mary can be seen. The birth of Mary is represented with two figures of midwives.</p>
<p>The floor is a Cosmatique work. The Cosmati were a family from the 12th century who laid mosaic floors with pieces of antique marble.</p>
<p>On the right in the nave is the empty grave of Francesco Armellini Medici. He was a hated cardinal, who taxed the population very much. Because of this, he became very rich and had this funerary monument built. When Rome was sacked by the troops of Charles V in 1527 he had to flee to the Castel Sant’Angelo. He then lost his fortune and was buried without honor somewhere else.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you enter under the balcony you will first end up in a hall. Here, on the far left and right sides you can see two statues. On the left side you can see a statue of Charlemagne, who was crowned by the Pope in the church in the year 800. On the right side is a more beautiful statue, made by Bernini. It is Constantine, the first Christian Emperor and the founder of the first Saint Peter’s Basilica. Here we see the vision of Constantine. He is sitting on his horse and looking up. In the sky he sees the sign of the cross. The next day we would make his soldiers paint this sign on their shields and they would go on to win the battle of the Milvian Bridge which would make Constantine Emperor. After this he started to sponsor Christianity. The main doors in the middle come from the old basilica. Inside there are 44 altars, 11 domes, 778 columns, 135 mosaic paintings and 395 statues. The church is 192 meters long. It is the largest church in the world and they have markings to prove it. In the middle of the church the names and lengths of other churches can be seen. This is why the middle section is blocked, so that people stop walking over the markings.</p>
<p><span id="more-616"></span></p>
<p>The doors on the right are the Holy Doors. They are opened only every 25 years in a Jubilee year, a Holy year. This If you look at them from the inside you will see the entrance is closed with bricks. This tradition was started by Alexander VI, the Borgia Pope. The last time they were opened was in the year 2000 by Pope John Paul II. They are made of bronze. The opening of the doors always takes place on Christmas eve. The Pope knocks on the doors with a silver hammer and they open up. He is he first to go through and followed by rest of clergy and pilgrims. This happens in all the mayor Basilica’s of Rome. Santa Maria Maggiore, Saint John Lateran and Saint Paul outside the walls all have holy doors. They symbolize the entrance to heaven and if you pass through your sins are supposedly forgiven. After the Holy year the doors are closed with bricks again.</p>
<p>Enter the main door go straight to the left where you will see a red circle on the floor. The circle we are standing on is made of porphyry, the same expensive stone from which Nero’s bathtub in the Vatican museums is made. On this spot, but a few meters below, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by the Pope on Christmas eve in the year 800. Mother Teresa, Queen Elizabeth, Lady Diana and even George Clooney have all stood here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the heart of Catholicism, Saint Peter’s Basilica. If you enter the church for the first time you might need some time to get accustomed to the sheer size of the church and its decorations. Don’t worry, it is normal. Just move away from the masses and let it sink in for a bit.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a bit about the history of this site. Do you know what this site was before St. Peter&#8217;s Basilica was built? It was Caligula’s Circus, which was later enlarged by Nero. Nero reigned from 54AD to 68AD and during his reign there was a great fire in 64AD. Nero had to blame somebody for the fire, because some people said he started it himself to make room for his new Golden Palace, the Domus Aurea. So Nero blamed the Christians, which was considered a new strange sect and told them that the Roman Gods were angry at them for worshiping only one God.</p>
<p><span id="more-614"></span></p>
<p>Nero was the first to persecute Christians. Saint Peter died during these persecutions. Peter had heard people wanted to arrest him so he left Rome, but just as he had left the city gates and was walking down Via Appia he came across Jesus who was walking the other way. Peter then famously said ‘Quo Vadis Domine’, where are you going my Lord. Jesus then replied that he was going back to Rome to be crucified again. Peter then knew that his time had come and he had to go back to Rome and die for his faith. He was arrested and then crucified in Nero’s Circus. Peter asked to be crucified upside down, because he thought he was not worthy to be crucified the same way as Jesus. Peter was then buried in a small necropolis next to the circus and over time this became a place for worship for the increasing number of Christians in the city.</p>
<p>Then Emperor Constantine decided to become Christian. He soon after ordered the building of Saint Peters Basilica. The building was built on the site of Saint Peters burial place. Construction was started in 324. The Basilica was consecrated in 326.</p>
<p>Of course the building you see today is not that building. Saint Peters was rebuilt in the 16th century in a renaissance and Baroque style. It was Pope Julius II who ordered that the old Basilica had to be torn down and a new one be built in 1506. He commissioned the famous renaissance architect Donato Bramante to design a new church. Of course both Julius II and Bramante died during the same decade and so the plan changed quite a few times (some of the architects that were involved were Raphael and Antonio da Sangallo) until in 1546 Michelangelo who was now 70 years old was assigned as the main architect for the Basilica. Michelangelo did not get paid for his work; he did it for the glory of the work and for his own salvation. He died at the age of 88 and work on the dome ceased for 24 years. It was finally finished in 22 months by Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana.</p>
<p>The original plan was for a church with a Greek cross floor plan, instead of a Latin cross, but in 1600 Pope Paul V commissioned Carlo Maderna to change the floor plan into a Latin cross. This way the church became much bigger than originally intended. Carlo Maderna is also responsible for the facade of the church and for the fountain on the right side of the piazza. Bernini added the other fountain to make it more symmetrical. Students of Bernini added the sculptures on top of the facade. You can see Christ in the middle and 10 apostles, replacing Judas with John the Baptist.</p>
<p>Paulus V added the text on the facade &#8216;In Honorem Principis Apost. &#8211; Paulus v Burghesius Romanus Pont. Max. Anno MDCXII &#8211; Pont. VII&#8217; which means In honor of the prince of apostles, Pontifex Maximus Paul V of the Borghese family made this in the year 1612. The letters are 2 meters high.</p>
<p>It took 120 years to build the Church; Most of the material is marble, granite and travertine. Some of it came from Colosseum and Forum, where it was taken from ancient buildings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The San Clemente is one of the most interesting churches in Rome. It consists of three layers. Under the main church from the 12th century you can find another church from the 4th century and under that there is an old roman house with a sanctuary to Mithras. The first church on the middle level was erected in the 4th century and named after the 4th Pope Saint Clement, who used to live on this spot. This church was partly destroyed in the 11th century by a Norman conqueror and then a new church was built on top of the remains of the others.</p>
<p>Clement was banished to the Crimea by the Romans because of his success in converting people to Christianity, but even from there he kept on converting lots of people. He then was given an ultimatum: Or worship the Roman gods or die. He decided to continue converting and was then thrown into the Black sea, tied to an anchor. Afterwards, the sea would open once a year, so people could erect a shrine and worship Clements relics. On one of these occasions a widow lost her only son, but he was found alive and well a year later when the sea opened again.</p>

<p>The columns in the nave of the upper church came from the Forum Romanum. They were taken from other buildings and reused here. This happened often in the middle ages.</p>
<p>You can also see a Schola Cantorum, which divides the choir from the rest of the church. This is actually a structure from the 6th century and precedes the upper church. You can see typical early Christian motives like fish, doves and vines.</p>

<figure id="attachment_328" style="width: 624px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image246.jpg"><img class="wp-image-328 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image246.jpg?resize=624%2C461" alt="Mosaics in the San Clemente" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Mosaics in the San Clemente</figcaption></figure>
<p>There is a mosaic on the triumphal arch above the altar from the 12th century. In the upper right corner you can see Clement with an anchor. The remains of Clement and the anchor were transported to this church in the 9th century. On the left you can see the apostle Paul together with Saint Lawrence.</p>
<p>The mosaic on the apse depicts the triumph of the cross. You can see the tree of life. The twelve doves on the cross symbolizes the twelve apostles, just like the twelve sheep below. Around them you can see the people that work in the vineyard of the lord surrounded by monks, slaves, sheep, peacocks, which symbolizes immortality, and birdcages.</p>
<h2>Chapel of Saint Catherine of Alexandria</h2>
<figure id="attachment_329" style="width: 624px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image247.jpg"><img class="wp-image-329 size-full" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image247.jpg?resize=624%2C468" alt="Chapel of Saint Catherine of Alexandria" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Chapel of Saint Catherine of Alexandria</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the chapel of Saint Catherine of Alexandria you can see a fresco by Masolino da Panicale from Florence. Catherine was the daughter of an Egyptian king who refused to marry Emperor Maxentius, because she was a Christian (and he was not). Maxentius cannot get her to worship the roman gods, even after he sends pagan priest and philosophers to convince her. She converts them instead. The Emperor then condemned them to be burned alive. Catharina then criticizes Maxentius because of this, who then condemns her to death by starvation. In the prison a pigeon brings Catharina food. She is then tortured on a wheel with sharp pins, but the wheel broke. Then she was decapitated and from her wounds milk flowed instead of blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first scene depicts the dispute between Catharina and the pagan priests.</li>
<li>The second scene shows Catherine’s missionary work.</li>
<li>Here she converted Maxentius’ wife.</li>
<li>In the next scene she is rescued by an angel while being tortured on the wheel.</li>
<li>The last scene depicts her decapitation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Lower Church</h2>
<p>After you buy a ticket you can visit the Lower Church. This church was built in the 4th century. You can see inscriptions from pagan times and from Christian times. You can also see the remains of some 11th century frescos. Stories from the life of Clement are depicted, like the story of the boy who stayed a year under the sea and was unharmed, because Clement protected him.</p>
<figure id="attachment_330" style="width: 622px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image248.jpg"><img class="wp-image-330 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image248.jpg?resize=622%2C358" alt="Fresco of Saint Alessio" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fresco of Saint Alessio</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the nave you can see some more damaged frescoes from the 9th century. You can see Pope Leo IV and also the legend of Saint Alessio, who left his bride on his wedding night to go on a pilgrimage. When he came back, nobody recognized him and he lived like a beggar under the stairs of his parental home. Only after his death a Pope recognized him in a dream.</p>
<p>On the left side you pass the grave of Saint Cyrillus, the apostle of the Slavic people. He created the Slavic or Cyrillic alphabet, to properly translate the bible into the Slavic languages. It was he who gave the remains of Saint clement to the church and that is why his is buried here. Often Greek-Orthodox priests or monks visit his grave.</p>
<h2>Roman House with Mithraeum</h2>
<figure id="attachment_331" style="width: 622px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image249.jpg"><img class="wp-image-331 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image249.jpg?resize=622%2C413" alt="Mithraeum under San Clemente" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Mithraeum under San Clemente</figcaption></figure>
<p>After you pass the grave you can enter the third level. Below the lower church is an ancient Mithraeum. The cult of Mithras was very popular in Rome and was a big rival of the new Christian cult. It was very popular under Roman legionnaires. Mithras was always worshipped in a natural cave with a ceiling representing heaven. In the ceiling you can see 11 holes, representing 7 planets and 4 seasons. Mithras was born from a rock on the 25th of December. It is interesting to know that the cult of Mithras is older than Christianity. Some shepherds were present at his birth. Apollo, the god of light told Mithras to kill the cosmic bull, to save humanity. When Mithras was fighting the bull the god of evil sent a snake and a scorpion, who bit the bull in his testicles to prevent him from procreating. All animal and plant life was created by the flow of the bulls’ semen. After the scorpion was crushed, its blood created all evil. In the sanctuary there is a prominent picture of Mithras and the bull. You can see the place followers of the cult used to sit on both sides of the cave. Here they had banquets with meat and blood from a bull, to celebrate Mithras’ victory. Afterwards, this space was used as catacombs, where Christians were buried. You can also visit the remains of a 1st century house. You can hear water run, but nobody knows where it comes from. It is probably an ancient roman waterway.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santi Quattro Coronati is a very interesting but relatively unknown church. It used to be a fortress and monastery, which protected the Lateran palace, where the Popes used to live before they moved to southern France and then to the Vatican. It was built in the 4th century and rebuilt in the 11th century after the Normans attacked. Now, Augustinian nuns live here. The floor is especially notable, because at least 200 antique marble stones were used to make the pattern.</p>
<p><span id="more-530"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_187" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image112.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-187" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image112.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Inside the Quattro Coronati" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Inside the Quattro Coronati</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the fresco on the apse the two stories of the Quattro Coronati are represented. Quattro Coronati means the four crowned ones. This refers to either 4 sculptors who refused to sculpt a statue of the pagan god Asclepius, who were then thrown in led coffins into the sea. The other four crowned ones were four soldiers who refused to carry out this sentence and who were tortured using sharp, red hot crowns. In the 17th century, when the fresco was painted, people had forgotten to which four crowned martyrs the church was dedicated so both groups were painted.</p>
<figure id="attachment_188" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image113.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-188" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image113.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="The Chapel of Sylvester" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Chapel of Sylvester</figcaption></figure>
<p>The highlight of the church is the chapel of Pope Sylvester with frescos from the 13th century. You get to this chapel by going outside the church to the courtyard, then enter the monastery and ring a bell next to the fence. A nun will then appear and you will give her a few euros. She will then buzz you in and you can go and see the chapel. Please do not skip this, if only for the experience.</p>
<p>The chapel is very small and is filled with frescoes from the 13th century. They show the legend of Pope Sylvester, a Pope who was appointed by Emperor Constantine. According to legend he converted Constantine to Christianity. He lived on a mountain as a hermit close to Rome. Constantine was suffering from the plague at the time as a punishment for having persecuted Christians. Roman senators advised him to bath in the blood of 3000 children. He couldn’t bring himself to kill so many children and in a dream he is visited by Saint Peter and Paul who tell him to go and visit Sylvester and enjoy a much healthier bath: baptism.  When he visited Sylvester he showed him pictures of the men (Saint Peter and Paul) that visited him in his dream and Constantine was impressed. He was then healed from the plague and became the first Christian Emperor. The next seven days he issued a lot of laws promoting Christianity and on the eighth day he personally laid the foundation of Saint Peter’s Basilica.</p>
<p>In the fresco above the entrance you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>The senators of Rome with Constantine in front of the mothers with the children in whose blood he was supposed to bath</li>
<li>Constantine in bed who dreams about Peter and Paul</li>
<li>Constantine on the road to the mountain where Sylvester lives</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_189" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image114.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-189" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image114.jpg?resize=300%2C213" alt="Peter &amp; Paul visit Constantine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Peter &amp; Paul visit Constantine</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the left wall you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constantine meeting Sylvester</li>
<li>Sylvester shows Constantine a picture of Peter and Paul</li>
<li>Constantine being baptized</li>
<li>Constantine makes Sylvester Pope and kneels in front of him and offers him the Lateran Palace</li>
<li>Sylvester arrives in Rome at the Lateran palace.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the right wall you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>The miracle of the bull. Jewish scribes argue with Sylvester while Constantine and his mother Helena attend. The Jewish scribes show the power of their religion by whispering something in the ear of a bull, who immediately dies. Sylvester then whispers the word Jesus in his ear, after which the bull comes back to live. Helena is instantly converted to Christianity.</li>
<li>Sylvester tames a dragon.  A dragon lived on the forum, which poisoned the air with his fumes. Sylvester prays to Mary and faces the dragon alone, armed with a silk thread and a statue of Christ. The dragon is paralyzed by the power of Christ and lets himself be bound with the silk thread. The dragon was then hit over his head with the statue and buried under the forum. The dragon probably symbolized an outbreak of Malaria in Rome.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have time try to go and see the Baptistery. It is a small building just outside St. John Lateran. It is the oldest of Rome and according to legend this is the place Emperor Constantine would have been baptized by Pope Sylvester I. The current building dates from 432. Its octagonal shape would influence the building of all later Baptisteries all over the world. The octagonal shape represents the 8th day of creation, when a man is created again by being baptized. It is built on the baths of the old house of Faustina, the second wife of Constantine. The basin is an old roman bathtub made from green basalt. The basin had to be big, because in this time adults were converted to Christianity and had to be baptized by submerging their whole body in water.</p>
<p>You can see frescoes with scenes from the life of John the Baptist and also scenes from the life of Constantine. The mosaic is from the 5th century. The deer represents the renewal of life. The deer blows water towards snakes in holes in the earth to get them out and trample them, just like god uses water to baptize people and drive out evil. The deer always looks for water to drink which represents humanities need for baptism.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The St. John Lateran is one of the most important churches in Rome. The area on which it is built once belonged to the Lateran family. Their property was confiscated because they had conspired against Emperor Nero and had sheltered Christians in their home. In the fourth century AD it was given by Emperor Constantine to the Pope, who built a church there. The Popes lived here also until 1305.</p>
<p><span id="more-522"></span></p>
<h2>The Lateran Palace</h2>
<figure id="attachment_289" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image209.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-289" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image209.jpg?resize=300%2C231" alt="Lateran Palace" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Lateran Palace</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Lateran Palace is attached to the church. It was built in 1586 and designed by Domenico Fontana. The Popes used to live on this spot before they moved to Avignon in France in the middle ages. When they came back, the Lateran Palace was uninhabitable so they moved to the Vatican. In the 16th century the ruins were taken down and this new palace was built.</p>
<h2>The Cathedral</h2>
<p>The Basilica is the actual church. It is the main cathedral of Rome. Until 1870 all Popes were crowned in this church. Emperor Constantine has personally put the first stone down. There is little left of the original cathedral, thanks to the sack of Rome by the Vandals, an earthquake in the 9th century and two fires in the 14th century. On the facade you can see 12 enormous statues. They are 7 meters high. You can see Christ, John the Baptist, John the evangelist and various Church Fathers. The facade was designed by Alessandro Galilei in 1735.</p>
<h2>The Interior of St. John Lateran</h2>
<p>The interior was designed by the influential baroque artist Borromini in 1646. Borromini was the great rival of Bernini and a very difficult person to work with. His architecture is on a very high aesthetic level though. One day he saw a kid destroying some marble blocks on purpose. He had him beaten up by his workmen who proceeded to kill the boy. The Pope was not pleased, but pardoned Borromini because he needed him to finish the cathedral.</p>
<p>The bronze doors were taken from the Curia, the senate building, on the Forum. The right door was made in the year 2000 by Floriano Bodini and is only opened every 25 years during a holy year. In the vestibule, on the left side, you can see a statue of Emperor Constantine, the founder of the church. It was taken from his bathing houses.</p>
<figure id="attachment_291" style="width: 198px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image211.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-291" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image211.jpg?resize=198%2C300" alt="Nave Statue St. John Lateran" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Nave Statue St. John Lateran</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the nave of the church you can see enormous statues on the left and right. They represent the 12 apostles and were made by students of Bernini. You can recognize the apostles by their attributes. Matthew is holding a money bag, Bartholomew is holding a knife.</p>
<h2>The Ceiling of St. John Lateran</h2>
<figure id="attachment_292" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image212.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-292" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image212.jpg?resize=300%2C223" alt="Ceiling of St. John Lateran" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ceiling of St. John Lateran</figcaption></figure>
<p>The coffered ceiling is from 1585. You can see many doves, which represent the family crest of Pope Innocent X, who commissioned the interior of the church.</p>
<figure id="attachment_293" style="width: 200px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image213.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-293" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image213.jpg?resize=200%2C300" alt="The Papal Altar" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Papal Altar</figcaption></figure>
<p>The papal altar is placed in a central spot, just like in Saint Peters. Only the Pope can say mass here. You can see a gothic canopy above the altar with 12 frescos from the 14th century. In the two silver busts behind the fence on the canopy the heads of Saint Peter and Paul are being kept. Just before the altar is the tomb of Pope Martin V, the Pope who brought the renaissance to Rome. He was the first Pope to rule alone after a string of rivaling Popes in the late middle ages.</p>
<figure id="attachment_294" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image214.jpg"><img class="wp-image-294 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image214.jpg?resize=300%2C250" alt="Fresco's by Cavalier d’Arpino and Apse Mosaic" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fresco&#8217;s by Cavalier d’Arpino and Apse Mosaic</figcaption></figure>
<p>The transept has frescos painted by Cavalier d’Arpino. They were painted around the year 1600 and show episodes from the history of this church. You can see the baptism of Emperor Constantine and the founding of San Giovanni.</p>
<p>The mosaic in the apse represents Christ as a savior. It is from the 4th century and the first public representation of Christ. Legend has it the mosaic of Christ was made by angels. The rest of the mosaic is from the 13th century. To the left of the cross you can see Mary, a Pope, Saint Francis of Assisi, Peter and Paul. To the right you can see John the Baptist, Saint Anthony of Padova, John the evangelist and Andreas the apostle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santa Maria della Vittoria is a very small church. Its fame derives from the statue which can be found inside. It is one of Bernini’s masterpieces, Teresa in Ecstasy. The church used to be a convent of the Carmelites. This order was reformed by Saint Teresa of Ávila. Teresa is one of three female doctors of the Church. She died in the night of the 4th to the 15th of October 1582. Incidentally, this was the night when a few days were skipped because of the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. She was canonized in 1622 and a few decades later Bernini designed the Cornaro chapel in this church to honor her.</p>
<p><span id="more-520"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_181" style="width: 225px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image106.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-181" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image106.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="Santa Teresa by Bernini" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Santa Teresa by Bernini</figcaption></figure>
<p>Bernini designed the chapel like a theatre. You can even see spectators in the tribunes. These are Cardinal Federico Cornaro and his ancestors. Of course the main statue is the one of Teresa in ecstasy. It is made from one piece of marble. Teresa described this scene in one of her books like this.</p>
<p>‘I saw an angel close by me, on my left side, in bodily form. This I am not accustomed to see, unless very rarely. Though I have visions of angels frequently, yet I see them only by an intellectual vision, such as I have spoken of before. It was our Lord&#8217;s will that in this vision I should see the angel in this way. He was not large, but small of stature, and most beautiful — his face burning, as if he were one of the highest angels, who seem to be all of fire: they must be those whom we call cherubim. Their names they never tell me; but I see very well that there is in heaven so great a difference between one angel and another, and between these and the others, that I cannot explain it.</p>
<p>I saw in his hand a long spear of gold, and at the iron&#8217;s point there seemed to be a little fire. He appeared to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it. The soul is satisfied now with nothing less than God. The pain is not bodily, but spiritual; though the body has its share in it, even a large one. It is a caressing of love so sweet which now takes place between the soul and God, that I pray God of His goodness to make him experience it who may think that I am lying.’</p>
<p>Bernini followed closely the description of the Saint, even in the slight erotic overtones of the description of her ecstasy. Teresa seems to float in the air and her face is looking ecstatic indeed. Because of the slight erotic feeling of the statue, some people have argued to remove it from the Church or even destroy it. French author Charles de Brosses wrote in the 18th century: ‘If this is heavenly love, then I know it very well’. Bernini himself considered this his masterpiece.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri is a church, built inside the ruins of the Baths of Diocletian. These baths were built in 305 AD and could hold 3000 people. The small middle part was transformed by Michelangelo into a church. If you have the chance, go inside, because it is amazing. You can see the simple doors and facade on one side of the square. Michelangelo decided against the building of a facade. He wanted to leave the ruins as they are. But when you go inside you can see how big the building is.</p>
<p><span id="more-516"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_178" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image104.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-178" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image104.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="Inside Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri " data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Inside Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri</figcaption></figure>
<p>Inside, you also can see that the shape of the church is unusual. It is not shaped like a Latin cross. This is of course because the building was destined to be a bathing complex. The church is called Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri, Saint Mary of the angels and martyrs. Inside the church you can see a long line on the floor. This was used to calculate the time of year. A hole in the ceiling would let a beam of sunlight in and on midday a ray of light would show the time of year on the line. This was used to calculate Easter.</p>
<p>On the right side of the church is the Museo Nazionale Romano. It was opened in 1899 in another part of the baths and it houses a collection of ancient statues. The museum now is very big with buildings all across town. You can buy one ticket and visit all of them throughout the city. If you are interested in Roman art, it is most definitely worth a visit.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This church is called Santa Maria Prassede, and although it is not well known, it is one of the oldest and most beautiful churches of Rome. The church is dedicated Praxedes, the daughter of a Roman senator, Pudens. Peter stayed in his house for some time and converted him to Christianity, together with her daughters Praxedes and Pudentiana. Praxedes dedicated her life to helping the poor and persecuted. She hid Christians in her house to protect them from Roman persecutions. When the Romans found out where their hiding place was they killed all 23 of them. Praxedes then used a sponge to collect their blood, which she kept in the well of her house. The Church is built on the location of her house.</p>
<p><span id="more-512"></span></p>
<p>In the central nave there is a porphyry disc which covers the old well where the blood and bodies of the martyrs are kept.</p>
<h2>Mosaics of Santa Prassede</h2>
<figure id="attachment_297" style="width: 602px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image217.jpg"><img class="wp-image-297 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image217.jpg?resize=602%2C283" alt="Arch Mosaic of Santa Prassede" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Arch Mosaic of Santa Prassede</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the arch closer to the nave you can see a heavenly Jerusalem depicted. You can see city walls and towers, which alludes to the Book of Revelation. Christ can be seen inside the city in the middle, wearing a red tunic. He is surrounded by Saints, like Mary, John the Baptist and of course Santa Prassede, Praxedes. Outside the gates of the city saved souls are waiting to enter.</p>
<p>In the crypt below the altar you can find the graves of Praxedes and Pudentiana.</p>
<figure id="attachment_298" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image218.jpg"><img class="wp-image-298 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image218.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="Apse Mosaic of Santa Prassede" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Apse Mosaic of Santa Prassede</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Church is most famous for its 9th century Byzantine mosaics, the only of their kind in Rome.  In the apse we see Christ with his right arm lifted up. He is wearing a tunic and sandals. He shows the palm of his hand with the sign of the crucifixion. The hand of god comes from the sky above him and carries a golden crown or wreath to put on Christ’s head. On the right of Christ you can see Peter with his hands around Pudentiana and on the left you can see Paul with his hands around Praxedes. They introduce both ladies to Christ. The hands of both women are covered, because it was customary to cover your hands when you presented gifts to the Emperor at that time. The two palm trees on both sides represent Paradise. Below the figures flows the river Jordan.</p>
<p>Above Christ we see the Lamb of God on a throne inside a blue medallion. The lamb represents the resurrected Christ. On both sides of the medallion we see seven candles, three on the left and four on the right. They represent the seven churches from Asia. Next to the candles on both sides we see angels, evangelists and 24 elders with white robes and crowns. They symbolize wisdom. You can recognize the evangelists by their symbols. John is the eagle, Luke the bull, the angel is Matthew and Mark the lion.</p>
<p>Below Christ we see the Lamb of God with the four rivers of Paradise, which flow until the end of the world. On the left you can see lambs coming out of Bethlehem, which represents the church of the pagans and on the right from Jerusalem, which represents the church of the Jews.</p>
<figure id="attachment_299" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image219.jpg"><img class="wp-image-299 size-full" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image219.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="Chapel of Bishop Zeno" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Chapel of Bishop Zeno</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can find some more amazing mosaics in the small chapel of bishop Zeno. These are the most beautiful Byzantine mosaics in Rome. You can see a lot of figures depicted. Many are Saints, like Mary, Zeno, the apostles, Agnes, Peter Jacob etc.</p>
<p>On the roof you can see a depiction of Christ as pantocrator, which is Greek for ruler of all things. Next to the window Saints Agnes, Pudentia and Praxedes are in procession towards the altar. You can also see a lamb on a mountain and deer who drink from four rivers of Paradise, which is a reference to baptizing. Above the altar is a picture of the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist at the feet of Christ.</p>
<figure id="attachment_300" style="width: 379px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image220.jpg"><img class="wp-image-300 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image220.jpg?resize=379%2C538" alt="First work of Bernini" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">First work of Bernini</figcaption></figure>
<p>Across the nave from the chapel of Zeno you can also see the first work of Bernini. It is the grave of the majordomo of the Pope, Santoni. Bernini made this when he was 15.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santa Maria Maggiore is one of the four papal basilicas of Rome and is also Vatican territory. It was built on the top of Esquiline hill, because of a dream of a Pope. In his dream, Pope Liberius was visited by an angel, who told him to build a church on top of the hill where snow would fall the next day. Of course, it was the middle of August, and snow does not normally fall at that time of the year. But the Pope woke up and saw that snow had fallen on top of Esquiline hill. He went over and discovered that the owner of the land had had the same dream. They then decided to build the church. This was in the 4th century. Every august this event is remembered by throwing white flowers in the air on August the 5th. The campanile, the bell tower, is a Romanesque structure from the 14th century. The facade is both baroque and medieval. If you stand in front of the Church, you can see that a newer, baroque facade is built around the older one. You can still see the medieval mosaic on what used to be the facade.</p>
<p>On the square in front of the church stands a Corinthian column, which came from Constantine&#8217;s Basilica on the Forum. On top, a bronze statue of Mary was put in 1614.</p>
<p><span id="more-510"></span></p>
<p>The facade was built in 1744, but through it you can still see the mosaic from the 1300s on the original facade. The mosaic tells the story of the dream and the snow. You can see Maria, Pope Liberius and the owner of the land on which the snow fell. On the right you can see the Pope drawing the design of the church in the snow. Unfortunately, it is very hard to see the mosaics well from down on the piazza.</p>
<p>The campanile is the highest in Rome. It is 75 meters high. Every day at half past nine the bells ring to help lost travelers with their orientation.</p>
<h2>Entrance of Santa Maria Maggiore</h2>
<p>In the entrance hall you can see on your right a statue of Philip IV of Spain, who awarded the church a yearly contribution. Ever since, Spanish kings give money to this church. On the right you can see the Porta Sancta, the holy door that is only opened in a Holy year by the Pope himself.</p>
<h2>The Interior of Santa Maria Maggiore</h2>
<figure id="attachment_311" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image230.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-311" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image230.jpg?resize=600%2C497" alt="The Interior of Santa Maria Maggiore" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Interior of Santa Maria Maggiore</figcaption></figure>
<p>The interior consists of a monumental mix of styles. The beautiful floor is a Cosmatesque work. The Cosmati were a family who were renowned in this area for their way of making beautiful floors. They use pieces of stone and glass to create geometric mosaics on church floors</p>
<p>The columns are still the original ones from the 5th century church. Also have a look at the renaissance ceiling. It is one of the most beautiful ceilings in Rome and is decorated with the first gold that was brought from America by Columbus. It was a gift from King Ferdinand of Aragon</p>
<p>Above the nave you can see 28 small mosaics from the 5th century with biblical stories.</p>
<h2>Crypt of the Nativity</h2>
<figure id="attachment_312" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image231.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-312" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image231.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="Crypt of the Nativity" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Crypt of the Nativity</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the area under the high altar a very important relic is being kept in the Crypt of the Nativity. It is the Holy Manger in which Christ was laid down after he was born. You can see the old pieces of wood in a silver and glass urn. Pope Theodor I took it from Bethlehem to Rome in the 7th century. The pieces of the manger are taken in procession through the church, every year on Christmas eve. The statue of the praying Pope represents Pope Pius IX from the 19th century. This crypt is also the burial place of Saint Jerome, one of the Doctors of the Church, who translated the bible in Latin in the 4th century.</p>
<h2>Apse Mosaic</h2>
<p>In the mosaic on the arch above the altar you can see four stories from the life of Mary: the annunciation, the adoration of the Magi, the Presentation of Mary  and the Flight to Egypt. The apse mosaic is from 1295 and made by Franciscan friar Jacopo Torriti, who dated and signed it. The main theme is the Triumph of Mary. Mary sits next to Christ as his equal in heaven. The Franciscans claimed for a very long time that Mary, after her death, ascended immediately to heaven. This dogma was only made official by Pope Pius IX in 1854.</p>
<h2>The Borghese Chapel</h2>
<p>The Borghese Chapel is located on the far left. It was built in 1611 and named after Pope Paul V of the Borghese family. Pauline Bonaparte, Napoleon’s sister, is buried here in the Borghese Crypt, but you cannot see her grave. The painting of the Madonna with child above the altar would have been painted by Saint Luke himself and finished by angels. The painting was already used in processions through Rome in 590 by Pope Gregory the Great to stop an epidemic of the pest.</p>
<figure id="attachment_313" style="width: 355px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image232.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-313" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image232.jpg?resize=355%2C533" alt="Sistine Chapel of Santa Maria Maggiore" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sistine Chapel of Santa Maria Maggiore</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the Santa Maria Maggiore there is also a Sistine Chapel. It is the last big chapel on the right. It was named after Pope Sixtus V, and not after Sixtus IV who commissioned the other, more famous Sistine Chapel at the Vatican. It was built in the 16th century by Domenico Fontana. You can see a tabernacle from the 16th century here which is supported by four bronze angels. There are also some Papal graves here. On the left and right Pius V and Sixtus V are buried. Sixtus V was a very tough Pope. On the bas relief on his grave you see a depiction of the heads of highwaymen that are brought into the city after a Papal campaign against them. On one day he could hang 60 of them, while he was watching and having dinner.</p>
<p>Just outside the Sistine chapel is the humble grave of Gian Lorenzo Bernini.</p>
<h2>The baptistery</h2>
<p>The baptistery is located in the front of the church on the right side. Against the left wall of the chapel you can see a bust of a black man. It is the grave of Antonio Emanuele Funta, who was an ambassador from the Kingdom of the Congo, who was sent to Rome in 1604. His trip took two years and a year after he arrived he died.</p>
<h2>Chapel of Santi Michele e Pietro in Vincoli</h2>
<p>From here you can access a souvenir shop on the left in the Chapel of Santi Michele e Pietro in Vincoli. The floors in this chapel are especially noteworthy. It is a brilliant example of Cosmatesque work. None of the patterns on the floor is the same. This is to express the uniqueness of God.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The church on the island is dedicated to St. Bartholomew, one of the apostles of Jesus. It was built around the year 1000 and a few centuries later the remains of the apostle Bartholomew were brought to the church, after which it was dedicated to him. His remains are buried below the main altar and the plate on which the remains were brought here can be seen on the right next to the altar. Michelangelo painted Bartholomew in his fresco of the last judgment in the Sistine Chapel. He is the one holding his own skin in his hand, because he was skinned alive.</p>
<p><span id="more-457"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_140" style="width: 225px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image066.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-140" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image066.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="Colonna Infame" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Colonna Infame</figcaption></figure>
<p>In front of the church is the Colonna Infame. On this column, every year on August the 24th, the names of the people who had not observed communion during Easter were written down here for everyone to see. Fortunately, this tradition is discontinued.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The San Luigi dei Francesi is the national church of France in Rome. It was designed by Giacomo della Porta and executed by Domenico Fontana between 1518 and 1589. The facade has several statues with famous people from the history of France, like Charlemagne, Saint Louis, Saint Clothilde and Saint Jeanne of Valois.</p>
<p>Inside is one of the masterpieces of Domenichino, a famous baroque painter. On the ceiling he painted the histories of Saint Cecilia. Domenichino was for a period considered one of the best painters of all time, but his fame is somewhat diminished now.</p>
<p><span id="more-437"></span></p>
<p>The church is most famous though for the three canvases painted by Caravaggio in the Contarelli Chapel. You can find these on in the chapel on the far left side.</p>

<p>They are ‘The calling of Saint Matthew’, one of Caravaggio’s absolute masterpieces, ‘The inspiration of Saint Matthew’ and ‘The martyrdom of Saint Matthew’. Caravaggio’s real name was Michelangelo Merisi, but he came from the town of Caravaggio, which explains his nickname. He was a very original painter. He was amazing in the depiction of light and dark. His subjects all look like contemporary people and he often used people he met in bars to pose for him. They always look poor and often have dirty nails. Caravaggio believed that Jesus and his apostles were also just normal people and not rich, so he painted them like that. This was often misunderstood in Caravaggio’s time. Caravaggio did not get along with his patrons and was often found in the pubs around town. Once, during a brawl, he killed someone and had to flee Rome, never to return.</p>
<p>Look at the calling of Saint Matthew, it is a true masterpiece. Jesus is in the dark, on the right side and points to Matthew who looks up from his game surprised and points at himself, like he is saying ‘Me?’ See how the light emanates from Jesus and falls on Matthews face.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you pass by the Sant’Ignazio, you should definitely go in, even if it is just for a second. But before you do so, have a look at the Piazza Sant’Ignazio in front of it. It is a very nice example of baroque architecture. Look at how playful the buildings are built. This is not a geometric design of the renaissance anymore. Everything is rounded. Then, when you go inside, you will be amazed by the ceiling of the church.</p>
<figure id="attachment_118" style="width: 417px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image044.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-118" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image044.jpg?resize=417%2C268" alt="Ceiling of Sant'Ignazio" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ceiling of Sant&#8217;Ignazio</figcaption></figure>
<p>It is an amazing example of perspective painting. If you stand on the marker in the middle of the nave of the church and look up, the perspective in the ceiling fresco is exactly right and the ceiling looks much higher than it actually is. But if you move to other parts of the church, the illusion is broken. You can try it by walking all the way to the altar and look back to the ceiling of the nave. It is an amazing fresco and it was painted by a Jesuit monk, called Andrea Pozzo, who was also a mathematician. In it, he depicts the triumph of Saint Ignatius, the founder of the Jesuit order. Right in the middle of the fresco you can see Jesus, hanging on to his cross. From Jesus, a ray of light shoots towards Ignatius, who is sitting on a cloud. The light is then reflected by Ignatius and illuminates the four continents. These continents are reflected by the four pillars in the corners of the fresco. Their names are written on the pillars as well: Africa, Europe, Asia and America. Australia had not yet been discovered. The continents are also recognizable by symbols. A Native American can be seen around the American pillar and a black queen around the African.</p>
<figure id="attachment_119" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image045.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-119" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image045.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Dome of Sant'Ignazio" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dome of Sant&#8217;Ignazio</figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there is also the dome. The dome is not real, but also painted. The monks of the adjacent monastery did not want the big dome blocking the light in their library, so they asked the Jesuits to not build a dome. They did not build a dome, but instead asked Andrea Pozzo to paint one. It is a gigantic trompe-l&#8217;oeil.</p>
<p>The church itself is a typical example of Roman baroque style. It is, of course, a Jesuit church and the baroque was a style the Jesuits often liked to use in their buildings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This church, adjacent to the Pantheon, is the only Gothic church in Rome. It is called Santa Maria Sopra Minerva. Sopra means above, so the church was built on top of a temple dedicated to Minerva. Churches were often built on top of temples. After Christianity replaced paganism, the temples were no longer needed and were considered blasphemous. So they were torn down and with the building material recovered churches were built.</p>
<p>The facade is simple and dates from the renaissance, but the interior of the church is gothic. The gothic style was never very popular in Italy and at the time of the style’s popularity the Popes lived in Avignon in France, so not much was built in Rome at that time. The church belongs to the Dominican friars. On the right side on the facade markers can be seen which show how high the water would rise sometimes. This area was prone to flooding until the banks of the Tiber were strengthened in the 19th century.</p>
<p><span id="more-430"></span></p>
<h2>Interior of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva</h2>
<figure id="attachment_303" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image223.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-303" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image223.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="Interior of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Interior of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva</figcaption></figure>
<p>Inside the church, an early work of Michelangelo can be seen. It is a statue representing the resurrected Christ and you can see it to the left of the altar. On the other side is a Christ on the cross, which was started by Michelangelo, but finished by another artist.</p>
<h2>The grave of Saint Catharine of Siena</h2>
<figure id="attachment_305" style="width: 603px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image225.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-305" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image225.jpg?resize=603%2C390" alt="The grave of Saint Catharine of Siena" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The grave of Saint Catharine of Siena</figcaption></figure>
<p>The grave of Saint Catharine of Siena is also inside the church. She was a Dominican nun and lived in the 14th century. She played a very big part in the return of the Pope to Rome. The Popes were living in Avignon in France at the time and she wrote them letters to convince them to come back to Rome. She also took care of lepers and the poor in the city and received stigmata, the wounds of Christ, just like Saint Francis. She died when she was 33, just like Christ. She was proclaimed patron Saint of Rome, together with Saint Francis.</p>
<h2>The grave of Fra Angelico</h2>
<figure id="attachment_306" style="width: 341px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image226.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-306" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image226.jpg?resize=341%2C455" alt="The grave of Fra Angelico" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The grave of Fra Angelico</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the floor of the chapel on the left of the main altar, you can find the grave of renaissance painter Fra Angelico, who died in the monastery next to the church in 1455.</p>
<h2>Carafa Chapel</h2>
<figure id="attachment_307" style="width: 404px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image227.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-307" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image227.jpg?resize=404%2C606" alt="Carafa Chapel" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Carafa Chapel</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the Carafa Chapel at the end of the right transept you can see frescos by Filippino Lippi with the life of Thomas of Aquino, who was a Dominican monk and Church father. Filippino was the son of famous renaissance painter Fra Filippo Lippi, who was a monk, but not a very good one. He married a nun and fathered Filipino, who became a very good painter himself as well, as you can see. Two Medici Popes (Clement VII and Leo X) are buried in the church as well in tombs made by Antonio da Sangallo. On the left side is also the tomb of Paul IV, the Pope responsible for locking the Roman Jews up in the Ghetto.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pantheon is one of the most impressive monuments of ancient Rome. ‘Whoever visits Rome without visiting the Pantheon, returns like an ass’ is what the Romans say. This is probably the best preserved monument from antiquity. According to legend it is built on the spot where Romulus, founder of Rome, was taken by a cloud during a thunderstorm and forever disappeared. On the frieze you can see the words M.AGRIPPA.L.F.COS. TERTIUM.FECIT which means Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius built this during his third consulate. These letters are not original, but were added later. Thanks to the holes in the frieze historians found out what the original letters said and then replicas were made. For a long time people thought the Pantheon was built in the time of Emperor Augustus. Not a strange thought, considering on the facade it says so.</p>
<p><span id="more-426"></span></p>
<p>Agrippa was one of Augustus’ most trusted advisers and his son-in-law. We now know though that the Pantheon was in fact built 150 years later, during the reign of Emperor Hadrian. Hadrian had Agrippa’s pantheon completely rebuild in 124 AD. Agrippa’s pantheon was a lot smaller and less impressive. Some people say, Hadrian himself, who was very interested in architecture and arts, designed the Pantheon himself. It was dedicated to the 7 planet gods, like Jupiter and Venus. Their statues stood in the seven niches. Hadrian probably did not change the inscription on the front because he wanted to associate himself with the reign and figure of Augustus, the first Emperor and a very popular figure.</p>
<p>Agrippa had a Pantheon built on this spot as a reward to the gods. He had planned a military expedition against the Persians, but was hesitant. Then, when he was sleeping, Cybele, the goddess of fertility appeared to him in a dream and told him to make a sacrifice to Neptune. They would both then help him in his battles. To thank the gods Agrippa promised to build the temple he saw in the same dream in their honor. Of course he was victorious and came back and built an earlier version of the Pantheon on this spot which was dedicated to Cybele and Neptune. Only in 1892 archeologists found out the building could not have been constructed in the time of Agrippa. On all the bricks marks were found that were only used in Hadrian’s time.</p>
<p>The pantheon is still standing, because in 609 it was given to the Pope by the East-Roman Emperor Phocas. The Pope then made it into a church, which is why the building is still standing. He called it Santa Maria ad Martyres and had 28 carts with bones of martyrs brought here from the catacombs to be buried.</p>
<figure id="attachment_110" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image036.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-110" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image036.jpg?resize=300%2C289" alt="Columns of the Pantheon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Columns of the Pantheon</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the front porch you can see sixteen Corinthian Columns. They are 14 meter high (46 feet). They come from Egypt and are monoliths, which mean they are made out of one piece of stone. It took a couple of years to carve one. We know exactly where in Egypt they came from, because near the ancient quarry lies a broken column which is exactly the same. Before, there was a big staircase leading up to the front porch, but the street level has risen so much the steps have disappeared.</p>
<figure id="attachment_111" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image037.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-111" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image037.jpg?resize=300%2C211" alt="Doors of the Pantheon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Doors of the Pantheon</figcaption></figure>
<p>The doors are 7 meters (23 feet) high and are covered in bronze. They are still the original doors from antiquity. In the empty spaces left and right from the doors once stood two big statues of Emperor Augustus and his friend Agrippa. When you pass through the doors the space you are in comes as a big surprise. This is intentional. From the outside it is hard to see the dome, but then when you step inside you see this amazing space all around you. The ancient architects did this on purpose.</p>
<p>The diameter and height of the Pantheon are the same: 43.30 meter. The construction of the dome was a milestone in Roman building. The invention of some form of concrete made a construction like this possible. The concrete was poured on a wooden framework which formed the dome. The dome gets thinner higher up. This is to reduce the weight. Below the dome is almost 6 meters thick, but close to the opening it is just 1.5 meters. The coffers on the roof are not only there for artistic value but also to reduce the weight of the dome. The coffers were originally decorated with bronze rosettes. The diameter of the dome is higher than that of the dome of Saint Peter’s Basilica. Renaissance architect Filippo Brunelleschi came here to study the Pantheon, before designing his dome in Florence. Michelangelo also came here to study when he designed the dome of Saint Peter’s Basilica, but he made the diameter of his dome a bit smaller, to honor the unknown architect from Roman times.</p>
<figure id="attachment_112" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image038.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-112" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image038.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Dome of the Pantheon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dome of the Pantheon</figcaption></figure>
<p>The opening in the roof is the only source of light for the building. When it rains, the water falls on the floor and flows away through small holes in the floor. The diameter of the opening is nine meters and symbolizes the sun, around which all the other planets turn.</p>
<p>It was also built as an astronomical instrument. In antiquity people valued the two equinoxes very much. These days are the 21st of March and the 22nd of September. On these dates day and night are just as long. Also the two solstices were very important. These are the days (21st of July and the 21st of December) when the sun reaches its highest or lowest point. So if you would enter the Pantheon on the 21st of June on midday the sun would touch the ground exactly in front of the main entrance. In Roman times the Emperor would enter the Pantheon in full ceremonial robe and kiss the ground.</p>
<p>The Pantheon has often been vandalized. In 1632 Pope Urban VIII of the Barberini family took the bronze beams from the front porch and melted them down to create the Baldacchino in Saint Peter’s Basilica. He stole about 250.000 kilos of bronze. He had enough bronze left to also make 40 canons for the Castel Sant&#8217;Angelo. After this the Romans say, ‘Quod non fecerunt barbari, Barberini fecerunt’; what the barbarians didn’t do, the Barberinis did. Even now, almost 2000 years after it was built it is still used as a place of worship. The marble interior is mostly original.</p>
<figure id="attachment_113" style="width: 225px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image039.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-113" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image039.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="Tomb of Vittorio Emanuele II" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Tomb of Vittorio Emanuele II</figcaption></figure>
<p>Inside, you can also see the graves of some very important people in Italian history. The first king of a united Italy is buried here, Victor Emmanuel II and his son, king Umberto I, who was murdered by an anarchist from Brescia. His wife was Margherita, after which the famous pizza was named. The pizza reflects the colors of the Italian flag: red from the tomato sauce, white from the mozzarella cheese and green from the leaf of basil.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image040.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-114" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image040.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="Tomb of Raphael" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Tomb of Raphael</figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, Raphael Sanzio, the famous painter from Urbino is buried here. On his grave is a famous line which says ‘This is Raphael&#8217;s tomb, while he lived he made Mother Nature fear to be vanquished by him and, as he died, to die too’. There is also a sign remembering Maria Bibbiena, the girl he was supposed to marry. Unfortunately Raphael died three months before the wedding was supposed to take place. He was only 37 years old. Raphael was part of an artistic brotherhood which was based in the Pantheon, I Virtuosi del Pantheon. They held exhibitions here.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santa Maria dell’Anima is the German church. You can find it just behind Piazza Navona. Around this church the German pilgrims used to stay when they came to Rome. In the church is also the grave of the last non-Italian Pope before John Paul II. He was Hadrian VI and he was Dutch. He was made Pope because of the influence of his employer and student, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. His pontificate was not a success. He was way too strict for the Romans to handle. They were used to Popes like Alexander VI and Julius II, who had children and were more like renaissance princes. Everybody was very relieved when Hadrian died very soon. Signs of gratitude were put at the door of the Popes physician, who had not been able (or wanting) to save him.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know what this site was before St. Peter&#8217;s Basilica was built?  It was the Roman Emperor Caligula’s Circus, which was later enlarged by Nero. Nero reigned from 54AD to 68AD and during his reign there was a great fire in 64AD. A big part of Rome was turned into ashes. Fires were an enormous problem in that time. Fire departments did not exist. If a fire broke out, Romans would just tear down the buildings around the fire, to make sure it would not spread. Nero had to blame somebody for the fire, because some people said he started it himself to make room for his new Golden Palace, the Domus Aurea. So Nero blamed the Christians, which was considered a new strange sect and told them that the Roman Gods were angry at them for worshiping only one God.</p>
<p><span id="more-352"></span></p>
<p>Nero was the first Emperor to persecute Christians. Saint Peter died during these persecutions. Peter had heard people wanted to arrest him so he left Rome, but just as he had left the city gates and was walking down Via Appia he came across Jesus who was walking the other way. Peter then famously said ‘Quo Vadis Domine’, where are you going my Lord. Jesus then replied that he was going back to Rome to be crucified again. Peter then knew that his time had come and he had to go back to Rome and die for his faith. He was arrested and then crucified in Nero’s Circus. Peter asked to be crucified upside down, because he thought he was not worthy to be crucified the same way as Jesus. Peter was then buried in a small necropolis next to the circus and over time this became a place for worship for the increasing number of Christians in the city. Centuries later things changed quite radically. Emperor Constantine decided to become Christian. Historians do not agree if he was ever baptized, but it is a fact Constantine favored Christianity. He attributed a very important battle victory to the support of the Christian God. Some historians think he wanted to use this new religion to keep the Roman Empire together.</p>
<p>He soon ordered the building of Saint Peters Basilica. The building was built on the site of Saint Peters burial place. Construction was started in 324. The Basilica was consecrated in 326.  Of course the building you see today is not that building. Saint Peters was rebuilt in the 16th century in a renaissance and Baroque style. It was Pope Julius II who ordered that the old Basilica had to be torn down and a new one be built in 1506. He commissioned the famous renaissance architect Donato Bramante to design a new church. Both Julius II and Bramante died during the same decade and so the plan changed quite a few times (some of the architects that were involved were Raphael and Antonio da Sangallo) until in 1546 Michelangelo who was 70 years old was assigned as the main architect for the Basilica. Michelangelo did not get paid for his work; he did it for the glory of the work and for his own salvation. He died at the age of 88 and work on the dome ceased for 24 years.</p>
<p>It was finally finished in 22 months by Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana. The original plan was for a church with a Greek cross floor plan, instead of a Latin cross, but in 1600 Pope Paul V commissioned Carlo Maderno to change the floor plan into a Latin cross. This way the church became much bigger than originally intended. Carlo Maderno is also responsible for the facade of the church and for the fountain on the right side of the piazza. Bernini added the other fountain to make it more symmetrical. Students of Bernini added the sculptures on top of the facade. You can see Christ in the middle and 10 apostles, replacing Judas with John the Baptist. Paulus V added the text on the facade &#8216;In Honorem Principis Apost. &#8211; Paulus v Burghesius Romanus Pont. Max. Anno MDCXII &#8211; Pont. VII&#8217; which means &#8216;in honor of the prince of apostles, Pontifex Maximus Paul V of the Borghese family made this in the year 1612&#8242;. The letters are 2 meters high It took 120 years to build the Church; Most of the material is marble, granite and travertine. Some of it came from Colosseum and Forum, where it was taken from ancient buildings. You can read more about the interior of the Church in the Chapter about Saint Peter’s Basilica.</p>
