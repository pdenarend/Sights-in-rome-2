				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the middle, in front of the actual forum, you can see the Rostrum. This used to be a stage on which important speeches were held. Marc Anthony held his famous speech here after Julius Caesar had been killed. What he exactly said is unknown to us, but many people know Shakespeare’s rendition of the speech which starts with the famous words: Friends, Romans, Countrymen. Can you see the vertical lines on the front wall of the Rostra? Augustus had attached prows of the ships he had destroyed at the battle of Actium.</p>
<p>Cicero held many speeches here, including 14 very hostile speeches against Marc Anthony. He later took revenge by ordering the killing of Cicero and displaying his hands and head on the stage. It is said that more people came to see his head than had ever come to see his speeches.</p>
