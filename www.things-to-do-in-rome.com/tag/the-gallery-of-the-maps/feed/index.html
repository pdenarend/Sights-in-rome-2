				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Gallery of the Maps was commissioned by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. It is 120 meters long. It was painted and designed by the most famous cartographers, who were led by Ignazio Danti, a famous Dominican monk. They went out and studied all of Italy and then produced these maps. They are very accurate. If you compare them with modern maps they are about 84% accurate. This is of course an amazing achievement as they did not have aerial photography or satellites.</p>
<p>There are 40 maps in this room. You have to imagine you are walking on the Apennine Mountains, so all the maps to your left represent the west side of Italy and all the maps on your right represent the east of Italy. But beware; sometimes north and south are reversed.</p>
<p><span id="more-705"></span></p>
<p>Besides Italy you will see immediately on your left a map of the area around Avignon in France, which at that time was part of the papal possessions. The maps are a valuable source of information, because many of these villages you see on the maps now have disappeared. Many villages only live on in the last name of Italians who often took their last name from the place they were from, unless they were of noble birth. So it is Leonardo da Vinci, because he was from Vinci, a small village in Tuscany.</p>
<p>In the maps you can also see some famous historical battles being depicted, like the battle of Trasimeno where Hannibal defeated the Romans.</p>

<p>Do not forget to look at the ceilings they are breathtaking. We see 80 episodes from the history of the Catholic Church and Saints and all the stories took place in the territory beneath it.  They were painted in the 1600’s by a lot of different artists. The two lead painters were Girolamo Muziano and Cesare Nebbia.</p>
<p>In 1631 Pope Urban VIII had the maps completed and embellished with additional ornamental elements by Lucas Holste.</p>
