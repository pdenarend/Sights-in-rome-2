				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This church is called Santa Maria Prassede, and although it is not well known, it is one of the oldest and most beautiful churches of Rome. The church is dedicated Praxedes, the daughter of a Roman senator, Pudens. Peter stayed in his house for some time and converted him to Christianity, together with her daughters Praxedes and Pudentiana. Praxedes dedicated her life to helping the poor and persecuted. She hid Christians in her house to protect them from Roman persecutions. When the Romans found out where their hiding place was they killed all 23 of them. Praxedes then used a sponge to collect their blood, which she kept in the well of her house. The Church is built on the location of her house.</p>

<p>In the central nave there is a porphyry disc which covers the old well where the blood and bodies of the martyrs are kept.</p>
<h2>Mosaics of Santa Prassede</h2>
<figure id="attachment_297" style="width: 602px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image217.jpg"><img class="wp-image-297 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image217.jpg?resize=602%2C283" alt="Arch Mosaic of Santa Prassede" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Arch Mosaic of Santa Prassede</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the arch closer to the nave you can see a heavenly Jerusalem depicted. You can see city walls and towers, which alludes to the Book of Revelation. Christ can be seen inside the city in the middle, wearing a red tunic. He is surrounded by Saints, like Mary, John the Baptist and of course Santa Prassede, Praxedes. Outside the gates of the city saved souls are waiting to enter.</p>
<p>In the crypt below the altar you can find the graves of Praxedes and Pudentiana.</p>
<figure id="attachment_298" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image218.jpg"><img class="wp-image-298 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image218.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="Apse Mosaic of Santa Prassede" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Apse Mosaic of Santa Prassede</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Church is most famous for its 9th century Byzantine mosaics, the only of their kind in Rome.  In the apse we see Christ with his right arm lifted up. He is wearing a tunic and sandals. He shows the palm of his hand with the sign of the crucifixion. The hand of god comes from the sky above him and carries a golden crown or wreath to put on Christ’s head. On the right of Christ you can see Peter with his hands around Pudentiana and on the left you can see Paul with his hands around Praxedes. They introduce both ladies to Christ. The hands of both women are covered, because it was customary to cover your hands when you presented gifts to the Emperor at that time. The two palm trees on both sides represent Paradise. Below the figures flows the river Jordan.</p>
<p>Above Christ we see the Lamb of God on a throne inside a blue medallion. The lamb represents the resurrected Christ. On both sides of the medallion we see seven candles, three on the left and four on the right. They represent the seven churches from Asia. Next to the candles on both sides we see angels, evangelists and 24 elders with white robes and crowns. They symbolize wisdom. You can recognize the evangelists by their symbols. John is the eagle, Luke the bull, the angel is Matthew and Mark the lion.</p>
<p>Below Christ we see the Lamb of God with the four rivers of Paradise, which flow until the end of the world. On the left you can see lambs coming out of Bethlehem, which represents the church of the pagans and on the right from Jerusalem, which represents the church of the Jews.</p>
<figure id="attachment_299" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image219.jpg"><img class="wp-image-299 size-full" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image219.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="Chapel of Bishop Zeno" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Chapel of Bishop Zeno</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can find some more amazing mosaics in the small chapel of bishop Zeno. These are the most beautiful Byzantine mosaics in Rome. You can see a lot of figures depicted. Many are Saints, like Mary, Zeno, the apostles, Agnes, Peter Jacob etc.</p>
<p>On the roof you can see a depiction of Christ as pantocrator, which is Greek for ruler of all things. Next to the window Saints Agnes, Pudentia and Praxedes are in procession towards the altar. You can also see a lamb on a mountain and deer who drink from four rivers of Paradise, which is a reference to baptizing. Above the altar is a picture of the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist at the feet of Christ.</p>
<figure id="attachment_300" style="width: 379px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image220.jpg"><img class="wp-image-300 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image220.jpg?resize=379%2C538" alt="First work of Bernini" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">First work of Bernini</figcaption></figure>
<p>Across the nave from the chapel of Zeno you can also see the first work of Bernini. It is the grave of the majordomo of the Pope, Santoni. Bernini made this when he was 15.</p>
