				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Papal Palaces you can see on your right when you stand on St. Peter&#8217;s square when you face the church, were built in the late 1500s. Inside, there are 1400 rooms, 20 courtyards, an Olympic sized swimming pool, a bowling alley and a movie theater. The Pope lives on the third floor and his window is on the top level. It is the 2nd window to the far right. From here the Pope does the blessing on Sundays. Pope Francis has decided not to live in the papal palaces. He prefers a more modest home in the very Spartan hotel Pope John Paul II had constructed to house the cardinals when they come for the conclave, the election of a new Pope.</p>
