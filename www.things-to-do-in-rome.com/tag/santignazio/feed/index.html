				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you pass by the Sant’Ignazio, you should definitely go in, even if it is just for a second. But before you do so, have a look at the Piazza Sant’Ignazio in front of it. It is a very nice example of baroque architecture. Look at how playful the buildings are built. This is not a geometric design of the renaissance anymore. Everything is rounded. Then, when you go inside, you will be amazed by the ceiling of the church.</p>
<figure id="attachment_118" style="width: 417px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image044.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-118" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image044.jpg?resize=417%2C268" alt="Ceiling of Sant'Ignazio" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ceiling of Sant&#8217;Ignazio</figcaption></figure>
<p>It is an amazing example of perspective painting. If you stand on the marker in the middle of the nave of the church and look up, the perspective in the ceiling fresco is exactly right and the ceiling looks much higher than it actually is. But if you move to other parts of the church, the illusion is broken. You can try it by walking all the way to the altar and look back to the ceiling of the nave. It is an amazing fresco and it was painted by a Jesuit monk, called Andrea Pozzo, who was also a mathematician. In it, he depicts the triumph of Saint Ignatius, the founder of the Jesuit order. Right in the middle of the fresco you can see Jesus, hanging on to his cross. From Jesus, a ray of light shoots towards Ignatius, who is sitting on a cloud. The light is then reflected by Ignatius and illuminates the four continents. These continents are reflected by the four pillars in the corners of the fresco. Their names are written on the pillars as well: Africa, Europe, Asia and America. Australia had not yet been discovered. The continents are also recognizable by symbols. A Native American can be seen around the American pillar and a black queen around the African.</p>
<figure id="attachment_119" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image045.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-119" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image045.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Dome of Sant'Ignazio" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dome of Sant&#8217;Ignazio</figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there is also the dome. The dome is not real, but also painted. The monks of the adjacent monastery did not want the big dome blocking the light in their library, so they asked the Jesuits to not build a dome. They did not build a dome, but instead asked Andrea Pozzo to paint one. It is a gigantic trompe-l&#8217;oeil.</p>
<p>The church itself is a typical example of Roman baroque style. It is, of course, a Jesuit church and the baroque was a style the Jesuits often liked to use in their buildings.</p>
