				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ponte Sant’Angelo is the old bridge that connects the Vatican with the city Centre. It was built in 136 AD in the time of Emperor Hadrian. The three arches in the middle are the original ones from antiquity. On the bridge you can see 10 statues of angels. They were made by the workshop of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the amazing baroque sculptor. Bernini made two angels himself, but the Pope considered them too beautiful to be put outside. All the designs are Bernini’s although his students executed the work. They all hold objects from the story of the passion of Christ. You can see their robes wave in the wind. This is because Bernini knew they would stand outside in the wind. Before, this was the only bridge to the Vatican and all the pilgrims had to cross this bridge. Now a new bridge is standing next to it on which cars can pass the river.</p>
