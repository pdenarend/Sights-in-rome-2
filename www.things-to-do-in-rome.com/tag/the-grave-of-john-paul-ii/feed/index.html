				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the right side of Saint Peter&#8217;s Basilica you can see something new. The body of Pope John Paul II was transferred here recently after he was blessed. He now is one of the few Popes that are buried inside the Basilica and not in the crypts below.</p>
<p>Close to the grave you find the entrance to the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament</p>
<p>This is the only place in the Basilica where you can pray in silence. Inside you are not allowed to take pictures. The altar inside was designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the famous baroque sculptor.</p>
<p>Also near here is the funerary monument for Pope Gregory XIII. He is the one who commissioned the gallery of the maps inside the Vatican Museums. He founded the Astrology department at the Vatican and is still famous for giving us the Gregorian calendar, the calendar we still use today. Before this they used the Julian calendar, which Julius Caesar had introduced. This calendar was wrong, because every year was 11 minutes too short, so after a lot of years, the calendar was evidently wrong. Gregory had a team of specialists create a new, correct calendar.</p>
