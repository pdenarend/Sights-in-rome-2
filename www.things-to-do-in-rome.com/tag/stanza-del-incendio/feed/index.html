				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This room in the Vatican is called the Stanza del Incendio. Incendio means fire in Italian. This room was the Private dining room of the Pope.</p>
<p>The most famous fresco in this room was done by Raphael himself and it is called the Fire in the Borgo. It celebrates a miracle that took place in 847. There was a great fire in the Borgo, which is the residential area around the Vatican. Pope Leo IV appeared on the balcony and made the sign of the cross and the fire was miraculously extinguished. It is also interesting because behind the Pope we can see the façade of the old Saint Peters, the basilica that was built in the time of Emperor Constantine.</p>

<p>The figures on the left on the forefront is an allusion to the story of Aeneas who is fleeing from a burning Troy. He is considered the forefather of the roman people. You see him escaping with his son and with his father on his back. The Vestal Virgin, Rhea Silvia, who was the mother of the twins Romulus and Remus was a direct descendant of Aeneas and of course it was Romulus founded Rome, the city that still bears his name.</p>

<p>The rest of the room was done by students. You can see the battle of Ostia. Here we see the Pope winning a battle against the Saracens at Ostia, then the harbor of Rome.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image188.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-266" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image188.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="The Coronation of Charlemagne" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Coronation of Charlemagne</figcaption></figure>
<p>Coronation of Charlemagne Here we see the coronation of Charlemagne by the Pope in the year 800. This really happened on Christmas Eve in the old Saint Peter&#8217;s Basilica. Charlemagne was crowned Emperor by the Pope. This was very important for the papacy, because this way the Pope could say that his authority was higher than that of Emperors.</p>
