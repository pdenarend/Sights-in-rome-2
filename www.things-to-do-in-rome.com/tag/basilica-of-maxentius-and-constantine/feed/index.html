				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This huge structure is the Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine. It was started by Constantine’s rival Emperor Maxentius in 308 and completed under Constantine. This building was the largest on the Forum. Half of it is still standing, the other half has disappeared. The roof was covered with gilded tiles, which were later used for the old Saint Peter’s. The building was a Roman basilica, so it did not have a religious function. It served as courtroom and marketplace. Inside, in one of the niches, a huge statue of Constantine stood.</p>

<p>The influence of this building has been enormous. Many architects took inspiration from this building, especially renaissance artists like Bramante, Brunelleschi and Michelangelo. They came here and measured everything. They were really interested in the proportions of the build. You can clearly see the influence of this building in Saint Peter’s Basilica, or for example in Raphael’s fresco ‘the school of Athens’, inside the Vatican museums.</p>
