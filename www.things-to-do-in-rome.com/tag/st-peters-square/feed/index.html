				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saint Peter’s square was designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Bernini was one of the most important artists ever to work in Rome. He worked his whole life, which was very long, in the city and left many beautiful artworks. If you have the chance, go see his statues in the Galleria Borghese, one of the most beautiful museums in Rome.</p>
<p>He got this very important commission from Pope Alexander VII. This Pope really liked commissioning imposing structures and also liked to make an imposing impression wherever he went. Whenever he would go anywhere he would take 1000 soldiers with him.</p>
<p><span id="more-179"></span></p>
<p>Bernini created a square which symbolizes the arms of the Church, which welcomes you as you enter the square. We are sort of embraced by the square. The colonnade consists of 4 pillars behind each other. There is one central point on each side of the square, close to the fountains where it looks like there is only one pillar. This point is always easy to find, because lots of people stand on it to look at the pillars. On top of the colonnade there are 140 statues. They represent Saints and other important people in the history of the church. If you would like at them from close-by you would see they are not very polished. Bernini knew people would only see them from far.</p>
<p>By this time, Bernini had many artists working for him. If you look at all the statues on top of the colonnade you can imagine that he did not make all these himself. Bernini was a powerful artist with a big workshop.</p>
