				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Close to Campo di Fiore is Piazza Farnese. It is named after the Palazzo Farnese, which now houses the French Embassy. The palazzo was built using stones from the Colosseum. Maybe you noticed when you were looking at the Colosseum that half of the outer ring is missing. This is where the stones ended up. The architect of Palazzo Farnese got a permit to take as many stones as he could from the Colosseum in 24 hours, so he hired as many people as he could and that resulted in a big part of the Colosseum being destroyed. The palace was built for Alessandro Farnese, who became Pope Paul III. He had been made a cardinal when he was very young, because his sister Giulia had become the mistress of Pope Alexander VI. Michelangelo also worked on the palace and inside there are also famous frescos by Annibale Carraci, which you can only sometimes visit.</p>
<p>On the square you can see two fountains. Ancient bathtubs were taken from the baths of Caracalla to be used for the fountains.</p>
