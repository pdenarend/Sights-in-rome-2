				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Pantheon is one of the most impressive monuments of ancient Rome. ‘Whoever visits Rome without visiting the Pantheon, returns like an ass’ is what the Romans say. This is probably the best preserved monument from antiquity. According to legend it is built on the spot where Romulus, founder of Rome, was taken by a cloud during a thunderstorm and forever disappeared. On the frieze you can see the words M.AGRIPPA.L.F.COS. TERTIUM.FECIT which means Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius built this during his third consulate. These letters are not original, but were added later. Thanks to the holes in the frieze historians found out what the original letters said and then replicas were made. For a long time people thought the Pantheon was built in the time of Emperor Augustus. Not a strange thought, considering on the facade it says so.</p>
<p><span id="more-426"></span></p>
<p>Agrippa was one of Augustus’ most trusted advisers and his son-in-law. We now know though that the Pantheon was in fact built 150 years later, during the reign of Emperor Hadrian. Hadrian had Agrippa’s pantheon completely rebuild in 124 AD. Agrippa’s pantheon was a lot smaller and less impressive. Some people say, Hadrian himself, who was very interested in architecture and arts, designed the Pantheon himself. It was dedicated to the 7 planet gods, like Jupiter and Venus. Their statues stood in the seven niches. Hadrian probably did not change the inscription on the front because he wanted to associate himself with the reign and figure of Augustus, the first Emperor and a very popular figure.</p>
<p>Agrippa had a Pantheon built on this spot as a reward to the gods. He had planned a military expedition against the Persians, but was hesitant. Then, when he was sleeping, Cybele, the goddess of fertility appeared to him in a dream and told him to make a sacrifice to Neptune. They would both then help him in his battles. To thank the gods Agrippa promised to build the temple he saw in the same dream in their honor. Of course he was victorious and came back and built an earlier version of the Pantheon on this spot which was dedicated to Cybele and Neptune. Only in 1892 archeologists found out the building could not have been constructed in the time of Agrippa. On all the bricks marks were found that were only used in Hadrian’s time.</p>
<p>The pantheon is still standing, because in 609 it was given to the Pope by the East-Roman Emperor Phocas. The Pope then made it into a church, which is why the building is still standing. He called it Santa Maria ad Martyres and had 28 carts with bones of martyrs brought here from the catacombs to be buried.</p>
<figure id="attachment_110" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image036.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-110" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image036.jpg?resize=300%2C289" alt="Columns of the Pantheon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Columns of the Pantheon</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the front porch you can see sixteen Corinthian Columns. They are 14 meter high (46 feet). They come from Egypt and are monoliths, which mean they are made out of one piece of stone. It took a couple of years to carve one. We know exactly where in Egypt they came from, because near the ancient quarry lies a broken column which is exactly the same. Before, there was a big staircase leading up to the front porch, but the street level has risen so much the steps have disappeared.</p>
<figure id="attachment_111" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image037.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-111" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image037.jpg?resize=300%2C211" alt="Doors of the Pantheon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Doors of the Pantheon</figcaption></figure>
<p>The doors are 7 meters (23 feet) high and are covered in bronze. They are still the original doors from antiquity. In the empty spaces left and right from the doors once stood two big statues of Emperor Augustus and his friend Agrippa. When you pass through the doors the space you are in comes as a big surprise. This is intentional. From the outside it is hard to see the dome, but then when you step inside you see this amazing space all around you. The ancient architects did this on purpose.</p>
<p>The diameter and height of the Pantheon are the same: 43.30 meter. The construction of the dome was a milestone in Roman building. The invention of some form of concrete made a construction like this possible. The concrete was poured on a wooden framework which formed the dome. The dome gets thinner higher up. This is to reduce the weight. Below the dome is almost 6 meters thick, but close to the opening it is just 1.5 meters. The coffers on the roof are not only there for artistic value but also to reduce the weight of the dome. The coffers were originally decorated with bronze rosettes. The diameter of the dome is higher than that of the dome of Saint Peter’s Basilica. Renaissance architect Filippo Brunelleschi came here to study the Pantheon, before designing his dome in Florence. Michelangelo also came here to study when he designed the dome of Saint Peter’s Basilica, but he made the diameter of his dome a bit smaller, to honor the unknown architect from Roman times.</p>
<figure id="attachment_112" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image038.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-112" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image038.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Dome of the Pantheon" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dome of the Pantheon</figcaption></figure>
<p>The opening in the roof is the only source of light for the building. When it rains, the water falls on the floor and flows away through small holes in the floor. The diameter of the opening is nine meters and symbolizes the sun, around which all the other planets turn.</p>
<p>It was also built as an astronomical instrument. In antiquity people valued the two equinoxes very much. These days are the 21st of March and the 22nd of September. On these dates day and night are just as long. Also the two solstices were very important. These are the days (21st of July and the 21st of December) when the sun reaches its highest or lowest point. So if you would enter the Pantheon on the 21st of June on midday the sun would touch the ground exactly in front of the main entrance. In Roman times the Emperor would enter the Pantheon in full ceremonial robe and kiss the ground.</p>
<p>The Pantheon has often been vandalized. In 1632 Pope Urban VIII of the Barberini family took the bronze beams from the front porch and melted them down to create the Baldacchino in Saint Peter’s Basilica. He stole about 250.000 kilos of bronze. He had enough bronze left to also make 40 canons for the Castel Sant&#8217;Angelo. After this the Romans say, ‘Quod non fecerunt barbari, Barberini fecerunt’; what the barbarians didn’t do, the Barberinis did. Even now, almost 2000 years after it was built it is still used as a place of worship. The marble interior is mostly original.</p>

<p>Inside, you can also see the graves of some very important people in Italian history. The first king of a united Italy is buried here, Victor Emmanuel II and his son, king Umberto I, who was murdered by an anarchist from Brescia. His wife was Margherita, after which the famous pizza was named. The pizza reflects the colors of the Italian flag: red from the tomato sauce, white from the mozzarella cheese and green from the leaf of basil.</p>
<figure id="attachment_114" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image040.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-114" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image040.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="Tomb of Raphael" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Tomb of Raphael</figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, Raphael Sanzio, the famous painter from Urbino is buried here. On his grave is a famous line which says ‘This is Raphael&#8217;s tomb, while he lived he made Mother Nature fear to be vanquished by him and, as he died, to die too’. There is also a sign remembering Maria Bibbiena, the girl he was supposed to marry. Unfortunately Raphael died three months before the wedding was supposed to take place. He was only 37 years old. Raphael was part of an artistic brotherhood which was based in the Pantheon, I Virtuosi del Pantheon. They held exhibitions here.</p>
