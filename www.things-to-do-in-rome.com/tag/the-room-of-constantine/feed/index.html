				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Raphael rooms would have been Julius II private apartments. He moved here because he did not want to live in the apartments of one of his predecessors and his archenemy, Rodrigo Borgia, Pope Alexander VI. Also he thought the ceilings of the Borgia apartments were painted with scenes of debauchery. Donato Bramante, the famous first architect of the new Saint Peters, suggested Raphael Sanzio to Julius II for the painting of the rooms. Raphael was only 25 at the time and not a very well-known artist. It took a total of 16 years to complete all the rooms. Raphael worked on them from 1508 to 1520, but then he died, so the rooms were finished by his students.</p>
<p>The first room is the room of Constantine. It is the first room we enter, but it was the last to be painted. This room was used for receptions and official ceremonies. It’s based on designs by Raphael, but all done by his students, like Giulio Romano. The main theme of the room is the Triumph of Christianity over Paganism. If you look up to the ceiling you can see this theme depicted. A roman statue of a god lies broken on the floor while a crucifix is standing up.</p>
<p>The four major paintings show scenes from the life of Emperor Constantine, a very important Emperor who legalized Christianity.</p>

<figure id="attachment_254" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image176.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-254" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image176.jpg?resize=300%2C194" alt="The Vision of Constantine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Vision of Constantine</figcaption></figure>
<p>The first one represents the Vision of the Cross. Constantine wanted to become to sole ruler of the Roman Empire and so he had to defeat his rival Maxentius. Before the final battle he had a vision. An angel appeared and told him that if he fought in the sign of the cross he would be victories. The angel said ‘In hoc signo Vinces’ In this sign you will conquer. You can see the angel saying this but in Greek on the fresco. The next day Constantine had crosses painted on all of his soldier’s shields and in the battle at the Milvian Bridge he was victorious. You can see Constantine in his camp standing in front of his tent looking up to the sign of the cross in the sky.</p>
<figure id="attachment_255" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image177.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-255" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image177.jpg?resize=300%2C196" alt="The Battle at the Milvian Bridge" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Battle at the Milvian Bridge</figcaption></figure>
<p>The next fresco depicts the Battle at the Milvian Bridge. This is a bridge north of Rome which still exists. You can see Constantine victorious. He is the one on the white horse with a golden armor and a spear in his hands. The evil Maxentius drowns in the Tiber on his brown horse, looking at Constantine. You can also see that Constantine is protected by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, who are flying above Constantine during the battle.</p>
<figure id="attachment_256" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image178.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-256" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image178.jpg?resize=300%2C195" alt="The Baptism of Constantine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Baptism of Constantine</figcaption></figure>
<p>The next one represents the Baptism of Constantine. Constantine suffered of leprosy and his pagan advisers advised him to bathe in an innocent’s child blood. St Peter and St Paul appeared to him and told him to find Pope Sylvester I. Constantine then was baptized by the Pope and miraculously cured. This legend seems to be a fabrication however.</p>
<p>Most historians agree that if Constantine ever was baptized it was just before dying, because he believed it was impossible to be a good Emperor and a good Christian at the same time. Constantine did legalize Christianity though in the year 313 with the edict of Milan. The influence of Constantine on western history was almost unparalleled because of this. Before the Emperor started to favor Christianity about 5% of the population of the empire was Christian. After Constantine about 60% became Christian.</p>
<figure id="attachment_257" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image179.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-257" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image179.jpg?resize=300%2C195" alt="The Donation of Constantine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Donation of Constantine</figcaption></figure>
<p>The last fresco is the Donation of Constantine. For a long time it was believed that when Constantine left Rome to found Constantinople, he left his temporal power to Pope Sylvester I. The church was in possession of a document that claimed the papacy was the rightful ruler of the whole western world. For a long time Popes based their temporal power on this document. In the renaissance this document was discovered to be a forgery. The Latin used could never have been written in the time of Constantine and it was clear the document was written many centuries after the death of Constantine. On the fresco we see the Emperor kneeling before the Pope. This is pure propaganda! Emperors should kneel for Popes.</p>
