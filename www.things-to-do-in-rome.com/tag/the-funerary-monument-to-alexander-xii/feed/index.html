				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This beautiful and extravagant Funerary Monument to Alexander XII was designed by Bernini when he was very old, at the age of 80. He did work on it, with the help of his students. When Bernini got the commission he had one problem. There was a door in the place the monument was supposed to stand. So Bernini, very cleverly, used the door in his composition. How did he do it? You can see a skeleton coming from under the big cloth, with his hands up. In his hands he holds an hourglass, saying Alexander’s time has come. The cloth represents the cloth of death which covers everything and the door of course symbolizes the passage to the next life.</p>
<p>There are also the female figures which represent the four virtues of the Pope: Justice, Prudence, Charity and Truth. Take a good look at Truth; she has her foot over a globe. Bernini decided to make Italy very big, because Rome of course was the center of the world. Under Truth’s big toe you can see a horn coming from England. This refers to the problem the Church had VIII, who wanted a divorce from his wife which the Pope refused to grant. Henry then decided to form his own Church.</p>
