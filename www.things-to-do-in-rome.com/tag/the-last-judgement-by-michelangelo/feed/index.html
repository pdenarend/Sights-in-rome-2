				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After Michelangelo was finished with the ceiling he hoped never to paint again. He went on and created many more beautiful sculptures but after 24 years a new Pope decided he wanted Michelangelo to finish what he had started. It was Pope Paul III who became a very important patron of Michelangelo. Not only did he commission him to paint the last judgment in the Sistine chapel, he also convinced him that he would be a good architect. So he made him chief architect of Saint Peter’s, made him design a new Capitoline Hill and gave him many more project.</p>
<p>Michelangelo was now in his sixties, He started painting the Last Judgment, the enormous fresco you see painted at the altar wall in 1535 and finished 1541. It took him six years to finish. Two windows from the altar wall had to be closed and other frescos destroyed, including parts of Michelangelo’s own work.</p>
<p>The tone of this work is very different from that of the ceiling. The ceiling is about the coming of the savior. This work is much darker. It is the last judgment.</p>
<p><span id="more-731"></span></p>
<h2>Christ</h2>
<figure id="attachment_284" style="width: 214px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image204.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-284" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image204.jpg?resize=214%2C300" alt="The Last Judgement by Michelangelo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Last Judgement by Michelangelo</figcaption></figure>
<p>High in the middle of the fresco we see Christ. Now, does he look like the traditional Christ you see in other paintings? Not at all. He is beardless and very muscular. He looks almost like a classical god, which is not so strange to think, because Michelangelo used two statues we have seen earlier as a model for Christ. For his head he used the statue of the Apollo belvedere which we saw in the octagonal courtyard, and for his body he used the Belvedere Torso. He is a powerful figure. With one hand he raises the dead from their graves and with the other one he judges. He decides who goes to heaven and who goes to hell.</p>
<h2>The angels</h2>
<figure id="attachment_285" style="width: 188px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image205.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-285" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image205.jpg?resize=188%2C300" alt="The angels" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The angels</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you look below Christ you these wingless angels with trumpets. They awaken the dead. They carry two books. One book contains the list of the blessed souls and one of the damned. Can you guess which one is which? Of course the small book contains the list of the blessed. Only very few people will go to heaven, most will go to hell.</p>
<h2>Historical background</h2>
<p>The fresco has a very dark subject. This has everything to do with the time it was painted in. 24 years had passed since Michelangelo painted the ceiling and the positive spirit of the renaissance had faded. In 1527 the troops of Emperor Charles V had sacked Rome and Michelangelo was there when it happened. It is said this was the worst sack of the city ever, including the ones by the barbarians after the fall of the west-roman empire. Priests were murdered, nuns were raped, artworks destroyed. The unfinished basilica of Saint Peter’s was used as a stable.</p>
<p>Also in 1517 another thing had happened. In Germany there was an Augustinian monk who absolutely did not like the way the Popes were behaving. Traveling monks were selling indulgences in Germany to fund the building of Saint Peter’s and the many wars the Popes were fighting. If you bought an indulgence you could secure your place in heaven according to the Pope. This monk started a protest and in 1517 he put 95 theses on the church door in Wittenberg where he lived at the time. His name of course was Martin Luther and he started the protestant revolution. The Catholic Church lost many believers in the northern parts of Europe.</p>
<p>So the message in the fresco is beware of what you do. You have to follow the right path, the catholic path or else you are going to go to hell. Next to Christ we can see Saint Peter. His face is a portrait of Pope Paul III. We also can see on the left side a figure who is pulled up to heaven by an angel using a rosary. Of course Luther had said that rosaries are useless, so this is a clear attack on Luther by Michelangelo.</p>
<h2>Saints</h2>
<figure id="attachment_286" style="width: 213px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image206.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-286" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image206.jpg?resize=213%2C300" alt="Saint Bartholomew" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Saint Bartholomew</figcaption></figure>
<p>Around Christ we see many Saints. On the right side with the keys to heaven in his hand we can see Saint Peter. This is a portrait of Pope Paul III. On the right side below Christ we see Saint Bartholomew. He is holding his own skin in his handed because he was skinned alive. Now if you look at the skin it is not the same as Saint Bartholomew. It is actually a portrait of Michelangelo. He shows himself empty and tired because of all the work he had to do.</p>
<p>Left of Bartholomew we see Saint Lawrence. He is holding a grill in his hand because he was grilled alive. He was martyred during the reign of Emperor Valerian. According to legend they grilled him alive and at a certain point Lawrence lifted himself up and said ‘You can turn me over now, this side is done’.</p>
<p>Above him you can see Saint Andrew with his back turned to us. He is recognizable by the cross he is holding which is shaped like an X.</p>
<p>Left of Andrew we see Saint John and to his right side you see Mary next to Christ. She turns her head, because she is sorry for the people that go to hell.</p>
<p>All these figures represent the most important Churches in Rome. Saint Peters, Santa Maria Maggiore, Saint John in Lateran etc.</p>
<figure id="attachment_287" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image207.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-287" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image207.jpg?resize=300%2C186" alt="Angels with the Cross" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Angels with the Cross</figcaption></figure>
<p>Above Christ you can see angels holding up his crown of thorns, the Cross and the pillar against which Christ was whipped.</p>
<p>Then on your right side you can see this group of Saints. You can see Saint Sebastian all the way on the right, holding the arrows he was pierced with in his hand. Next to him is Saint Catherine of Alexandria, holding the wheel which she was tortured on. Now if you would go to the Capodimonte museum in Naples you could see a copy of this fresco done by an artist a few years after Michelangelo had finished. The amazing thing is that on this copy all these figures are naked. These were all dressed after Michelangelo had died and in the rest of the fresco many private parts were covered up, because later Popes thought the painting was indecent.</p>
<h2>Hell</h2>
<p>Then lastly on the right side just above the door we see hell. People are brought to Hell on a boat by Charon, a classical depiction of hell. In hell itself we see a man with ears like an ass and a snake around him. The snake bites him in a very unpleasant spot. This is a portrait of Biago de Cesena, who was the Pope’s master of ceremonies. When he saw the fresco when Michelangelo was working on it he said it belonged in a brothel and not in a church. This, because there were so many naked pictures in the painting. Michelangelo heard this and painted him in Hell as Minos, the judge of the underworld. Of course Biago was furious and went to see the Pope to complain. But Paul III said that as Pope he just had power over heaven, but whatever happened in hell he could not influence. So Biago is still there.</p>
<h2>Restoration</h2>
<p>The chapel was restored between 1981 and 1993. It took 12 years to restore what one man painted in ten years. The company that paid for the restoration was Nippon, a Japanese TV network. They paid 100 million dollars. It took hundred experts to restore everything. What Nippon asked for in return was exclusive photography right of the Sistine chapel for 10 years. What the art historians amazed the most after the restoration was done were the colors of the chapel. It turned out Michelangelo had used much brighter colors than anybody had ever believed. Because of candle smoke the frescoes had become dark, but when they were restored people at first thought the restorers had repainted the ceiling.</p>
