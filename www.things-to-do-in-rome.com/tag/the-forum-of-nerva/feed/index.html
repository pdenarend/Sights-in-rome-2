				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Across the Via dei Fori Imperiali some parts of the Forum of Nerva can be seen. Once, a nice temple of Minerva stood here. You can see all the forums are below the current level of the street. This is because during the last two millennia the city has become higher. You could call this due to the dust of ages. During the middle ages this area was not really used anymore. Cows were held here and slowly, thanks to dust and manure, the level of the ground rose considerably, until archeologist started digging in the 19th century.</p>

<p>Next to the forum of Nerva you can see what is left of the Forum of Augustus. He also built a temple in honor of the god of war Mars here when he won a battle against the murderers of Caesar, his adoptive father. Only three of the 24 columns are left.</p>
