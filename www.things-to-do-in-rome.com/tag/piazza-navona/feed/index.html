				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Piazza Navona is one of the most famous piazzas in Rome. In the time of the Roman republic not much was here. It was the Campus Martius, the field of Mars. It was used as training field for the legions and sport events were held here. During the empire this area was also used. The piazza you stand on now once was the Stadium of Domitian. It was a racetrack. If you look at the shape of the piazza you can clearly still see the shape of the old stadium. The name also comes from the stadium. Agones means games in Latin. Agones changed into Navona. 30000 people were able to watch athletic games in this stadium.</p>
<p>Piazza Navona got its current shape in the 17th century under Pope Innocent X of the Pamphili family. He wanted this square to be the most beautiful in Europe. Every August he would close the drains of the fountains and a small lake would be formed. It was 60 cm deep. Only in 1867 this tradition was discontinued and the square was paved. During Christmas, a nice Christmas Market is being held here and during normal times, artists sell paintings here. Be careful when buying though, it is said some come straight out of a computer printer.</p>
<p>There are many bars and restaurants on this square, but they tend to be too expensive for what they offer. In my view they only cater to tourists, most Romans never eat or drink here. When Romans want to drink a glass of wine on a Piazza they go to Campo de’ Fiori, very close to here. Another good option if you are looking for a more authentic restaurant experience is to walk into the street that is next to the Santa Agnese church on the Piazza. In the little streets behind this church you can find many nice restaurants and trattoria’s that are a lot better than what you find on Piazza Navona.</p>
