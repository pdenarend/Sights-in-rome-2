				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last statue under the dome of St. Peter&#8217;s is Saint Andrew, Patron Saint of Scotland and Greece. He was Peter’s brother and went to Greece to spread the Christian faith. He cured the Roman Governor’s wife of a serious illness and converted her to Christianity, but it is said that he persuaded her to also deny her husband his marital rights, which is what got him beheaded, not his preaching.
