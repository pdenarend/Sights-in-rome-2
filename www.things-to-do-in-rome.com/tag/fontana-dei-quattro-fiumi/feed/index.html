				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fountain in the middle is the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, designed and executed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. It is considered to be one of his masterpieces. Pope Innocent X did not like Bernini, because he had been very close with his predecessor, Urban VIII. Therefore, Innocent did not give Bernini any commissions. Bernini was very clever though and participated anonymously in the contest to design the fountain. Of course his design was a lot better than his competitors and Innocent was forced to hire Bernini. He said ‘the only way to avoid employing Bernini is not see his designs’. The fountain is from 1651 and its message is very typical of the time. It represents the Catholic Message which is diffused over the world. You can see four river gods sitting on rocks. They represent the four continents (the fifth was not yet discovered).</p>

<p>One river god represents the Nile in Africa. His face is covered by a piece of cloth, because at that time it was unknown where the Nile started. According to legend this figure holds his hand in front of the church that stands on that side of the Piazza; this is because Bernini disliked the architect of the church, his rival Borromini. The Ganges has a laurel wreath around his head and a peddle between the knees, because the Ganges is navigable. The Donau represents Europe and is recognizable by the Papal coat of arms. The river god representing the Rio de la Plata is recognizable by the coins at his feet, which represent the mineral riches of the Americas.</p>
<p>The Obelisk on top of the fountain is not from Egypt but was carved by the Romans.</p>
<p>Bernini really disliked this fountain. He thought he made it really badly. Every time he passed it in his carriage he would close the curtains, so he would not see it.</p>
