				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Cathedra Petri, at the back of Saint Peter&#8217;s was also made by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. To give you an idea of the dimensions, the wingspan of the dove is almost 2 meters or a little over 6 foot. The windows are made of alabaster. This is a stone which you would get if you compressed marble for millions of years. It has an interesting quality. It lets light through, which is why it was used here. It represents the light of the Holy Spirit. Next to the alabaster windows you can see small figures that become bigger the further they get from the window. Bernini wants to say here that all beings originate from the light of God.</p>
<p>Below you can see the seat of Saint Peter. It is being held up by four Church fathers. According to legend pieces of Saint Peter’s chair was used to create this bronze chair, but we now know this chair was probably a gift from an early French King. This chair was already in the old Basilica and had to get a new spot in the new one.</p>
