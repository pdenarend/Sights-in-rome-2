				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Down the Via Sacra you can see the Arch of Titus. It was built in 81 AD in honor of Emperor Titus who had quelled the rebellion in Jerusalem and had conquered that city. He took the treasure of the Temple and on the arch you can see the kind of things he took. You can see a Jewish seven-armed candleholder, a menorah, for example. Traditionally Jewish people refused to walk under the arch, but now itâ€™s not possible for anyone to walk under it.</p>
