				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This area is called Largo di Torre Argentina. Here you can see the remains of four temples from republican times. They were found in 1926. We don’t know to which gods they were dedicated, so we call the temples A, B, C and D. The temples were excavated in the time of Mussolini. Some people even accused him of just putting some rubble together just to show he had found another remnant of ancient Rome.</p>
<p>Maybe you have seen the many cats strolling around the temples. This is because on one side there is a cat sanctuary. Abandoned cats are being taken care of. You can even go downstairs and have a look around, but watch out, it really smells of cats. The volunteers sell some fun souvenirs as well.</p>
<p>Somewhere around the square the murder of Julius Caesar took place. The senate held meetings here while the senate building on the forum was being restored. In 44 BC Caesar was murdered by his fellow senators, who felt his reforms deprived them of power. More than 60 men conspired against him and he was stabbed to death by 23 stabs as he put his toga over his head.</p>
