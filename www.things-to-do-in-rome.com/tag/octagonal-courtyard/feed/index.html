				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the Octagonal courtyard; It was here the Vatican museums started. Julius II put the statue of the Laocoön and other ancient statues that he bought here for the public to see. The courtyard was transformed into an octagonal space in the 1700’s by Michelangelo Simonetti.</p>
<p>In this courtyard artists like Michelangelo, Raphael and Bernini sat down and studied the ancient sculptures. You must realize that at that time there were not so many known ancient sculptures. The collection of the Pope was very small. It was only later that most of the statues you have seen and will see were discovered. So the famous statues Michelangelo and Bernini studied were all found here.</p>

<p>Besides the statues we also see a lot of sarcophagi and bathtubs from ancient times. The bathtubs are made of marble or granite because these materials keep cool and in the summer it’s very hot here in Rome. You can feel them and notice how cool the rock is. They were brought here from ancient Roman baths around Rome. It is not known who the sarcophagi belonged to.</p>
