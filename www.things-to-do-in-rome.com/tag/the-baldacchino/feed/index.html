				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Baldacchino, the structure which covers the altar, is made of bronze and was designed by Bernini, for Pope Urban VIII from the Barberini family. If you look closely you can see small bees everywhere on the building. This is because the Barberini coat-of-arms consists of three bees. Bernini was only 26 years old at the time and it is an incredible and famous work. When it was built they needed bronze, so the Pope ordered for the bronze to be taken from the roof of the Pantheon. This is why there is a saying in Rome that says “what the barbarians didn’t do, the Barberini did). It weighs 120 tons and it took almost 10 years to build. The baldacchino represents heaven.</p>
