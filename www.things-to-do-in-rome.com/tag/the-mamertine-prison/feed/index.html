				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Mamertine Prison is located just outside the Forum, between the triumphal arch of Septimus Severus and Caesar’s Forum.  It is one of the oldest surviving prisons in the world. It dates from 64 BC and was mainly used to put prisoners who were sentenced to death. Gallic general Vercingetorix was decapitated here. When Nero was in power both Peter and Paul spent time in this prison. Pope Sylvester I made it into a Church.</p>
<p>When Peter was locked inside this prison he begged his guards for water, but they refused to give him any. Peter then hit the floor three times with his cane and water appeared immediately from the floor. With this water he then proceeded to baptize his guards and cellmates. Petrus was liberated by an angel who cut his chains with his wings. There is a beautiful fresco of this scene by Raphael in the Vatican Museums.</p>
