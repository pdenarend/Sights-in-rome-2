				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sistine Chapel is still used today for ceremonies like the election of the Pope. This is called a conclave, which comes from the Latin Cum Clave, which means with key. The cardinals are locked inside the chapel. In earlier times this was to make them quickly choose a new Pope. In medieval times it would sometimes take years before a new Pope was elected, so at some point the cardinals were locked inside the chapel to make sure they would hurry up. During a conclave a little stove is put in the chapel and a chimney leads the smoke out through the window. The cardinals write the name of their papal choice on a piece of paper and then votes are counted by three cardinals. Then the voting papers are burned. Before damp straw was added if no Pope was elected to turn the smoke black, but now they use chemicals. White smoke will appear from the chimney if the election is successful and nowadays also the bells will ring to make it absolutely clear.</p>
<p>There is a persistent legend the new Pope must be checked if he is male by feeling his testicles. This is an utter fabrication, which comes from the legend of Popess Joan, which is also a legend and nothing more.</p>
<p>Of course if a cardinal is elected he must first accept. After this he will go to a small room next to the Sistine chapel, which is called the crying room. Here he dresses himself in papal gowns. Three sizes are ready ever since John XXIII did not fit in his gowns. The new Pope is then taken to the balcony of Saint Peter&#8217;s and is introduced by the Latin phrase: Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum: Habemus Papam, which means I announce to you a great joy, we have a Pope.</p>
