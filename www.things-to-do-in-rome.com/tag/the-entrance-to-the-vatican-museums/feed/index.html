				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Paul II created this new entrance because the old entrance was not suitable to accommodate all the tourists. On average 15,000 people enter the museums. Also, since an attack on the Pietà, the famous statue by Michelangelo in Saint Peters, security had to be improved. So that is way you had to pass the scanners at the entrance.</p>
<p>When you arrive at the top of the escalators, the main museum is up the small stairs to your left, but I can advise you to first go straight into the little courtyard where you have an amazing view of the dome of Saint Peters, an amazing design by Michelangelo.</p>
<p>Even though Michelangelo was considered himself to be a sculptor, he had the capacity to become amazingly good at something in a very short time. So it was only later in his long life that Michelangelo started doing architecture. Michelangelo re-designed the dome in 1547, when he was 72 years old (He died when he was 88 years old), and came up with this amazing design. It is the tallest dome in the world with a height of 136.57 meters. Its diameter is just a little bit shorter than that of the pantheon, because Michelangelo wanted to honor the unknown ancient architect of that building. It is also a bit smaller than the dome in Florence in honor of the architect Filippo Brunelleschi, who was the first man who managed to build an enormous dome, something which no architect had managed since classical times. Michelangelo said himself that although his dome was higher, the one in Florence was more beautiful.</p>
