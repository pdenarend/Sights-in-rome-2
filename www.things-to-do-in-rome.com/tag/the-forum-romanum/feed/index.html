				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Forum Romanum once was the heart of Rome. From the 6th century BC onward, this was the place where the most important public buildings stood. It was the political and social center of first the republic and then the empire. Forum means market in Latin, so it all started as the main market square of the city. Before, this area was a swamp. Archaeologists have discovered that the romans added 5 meters of sand to this area so it could be used as a market. Also, a very large drain was constructed, the cloaca maxima, which transported rain water directly to the Tiber. The forum lies between Palatine hill and Capitoline hill. Of course now not much is left. If you walk around without realizing where you stand it is not a very impressive place. Now, of most buildings only the foundations are left. In the middle ages and the renaissance this area was used like a quarry, like the Colosseum. In fact, if you enter a medieval church in Rome you can often notice how every pillar is different. This is because they were taken from different Roman buildings.</p>

<p>In Roman times this place must have been very impressive. This is where the senate building stood. There was a podium on which famous romans held speeches, like Cicero and Marc Anthony. Many temples and courthouses stood here. Roman writer Plautus described a normal day on the forum like this:</p>
<p>‘If you need somebody for perjury, you should have a look at the area where meetings are held. Impostors and loud people you can find near the Temple of Cloacina. Rich folks that squander their money can be found in the shade of the hall of the market. There you can find withered prostitutes and all sorts of touts. In the lower market the rich citizens lounge around and on the middle forum, near the sewer you can see only posers.’</p>
<p>After the capital of the empire was moved to Constantinople the importance of the forum started decreasing. In the middle ages the center of the city moved northwest to the area near Piazza Navona. The place the forum used to be became known as the Campo Vacino, or the Cow’s field. Only in the 19th century the first scientific excavations were started.</p>
