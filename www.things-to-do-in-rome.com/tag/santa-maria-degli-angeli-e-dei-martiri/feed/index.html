				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri is a church, built inside the ruins of the Baths of Diocletian. These baths were built in 305 AD and could hold 3000 people. The small middle part was transformed by Michelangelo into a church. If you have the chance, go inside, because it is amazing. You can see the simple doors and facade on one side of the square. Michelangelo decided against the building of a facade. He wanted to leave the ruins as they are. But when you go inside you can see how big the building is.</p>

<figure id="attachment_178" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image104.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-178" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image104.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="Inside Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri " data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Inside Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri</figcaption></figure>
<p>Inside, you also can see that the shape of the church is unusual. It is not shaped like a Latin cross. This is of course because the building was destined to be a bathing complex. The church is called Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri, Saint Mary of the angels and martyrs. Inside the church you can see a long line on the floor. This was used to calculate the time of year. A hole in the ceiling would let a beam of sunlight in and on midday a ray of light would show the time of year on the line. This was used to calculate Easter.</p>
<p>On the right side of the church is the Museo Nazionale Romano. It was opened in 1899 in another part of the baths and it houses a collection of ancient statues. The museum now is very big with buildings all across town. You can buy one ticket and visit all of them throughout the city. If you are interested in Roman art, it is most definitely worth a visit.</p>
