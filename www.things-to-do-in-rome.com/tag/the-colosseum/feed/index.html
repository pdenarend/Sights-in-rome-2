				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As long as the Colosseum exists Rome will exist. When the Colosseum will be destroyed, Rome will be destroyed and when Rome will be destroyed, the world will be destroyed’. These famous words were spoken by an English monk in the 8th century AD. It was also him, Beda Venerabilis, who was the first one to call this building Colosseum. The Romans never knew this building as the Colosseum; they called it something completely different. They knew it as the Flavian Amphitheatre.</p>
<p>An Amphitheatre is basically a building which consists of two theatres put together. It was called Flavian after the name of the ruling family that constructed it. It was Emperor Vespasian, the first of the Flavian Emperors, who had it built. He was the Emperor that managed to take power in the civil war that followed Nero’s death. He had made his fame and fortune in Judea, modern Israel where he had stopped an uprising. When Vespasian took power he had to consolidate his reign. Nero, of course, had been crazy, but he was part of the first imperial family and could trace his ancestry back to the first Emperor Augustus. Vespasian was not even from a very noble family. So to get the people to like him he constructed the Colosseum, right on top of Nero’s enormous villa, the Domus Aurea.</p>
<p><span id="more-482"></span></p>
<p>Of course this was symbolic. Nero had built an enormous palace on the empty space that was created after the big fire, which destroyed half the city. Some people even whispered Nero had started the fire himself. He fiddled while Rome burned. Vespasian wanted to show that he was a very different Emperor. He thought of the people instead of himself. So on top of the palace Nero built for himself a building was made for everybody to enjoy. The palace consisted of a big space where besides palaces there were lakes, forests and a zoo. The Colosseum now stands right on the spot where the artificial lake was.</p>
<p>So why do we call it the Colosseum then? This is because it got its name from a big statue that used to stand next to it. This was a huge statue of Nero. After Nero’s death the head was changed to that of the Sun god. Everybody called the statue the Colossus. Then somewhere in the middle ages the statue was destroyed and the name got mixed up with that of the Colosseum.</p>

<p>Most Roman cities had an Amphitheatre. The reason they were built is to keep the people happy. In Rome the people got Panem et Circenses or bread and circuses. This was to keep the populace quiet. You have to remember that a substantial part of the roman people were slaves. It was probably something like 40%. They did most of the work, so many of the one million people that lived in Rome did not have much to do. So sometimes they would rise up. Then the Emperors started to provide them with free bread. A lot of grain was imported from Egypt. Then the people also got the games. Besides the fights of the gladiators and hunting games in the amphitheaters, they also got chariot races and theatrical plays, all for free.</p>
<p>The Colosseum was paid for with the money and valuables Vespasian’s son Titus had taken from Jerusalem. Construction started in 72 AD. Most of the work was done by 12.000 Jewish slaves, all captured when Titus put down the insurrection in Judea. The exterior is remarkably well conserved, but inside not much is left. Many rocks and ornaments were stolen to build churches and other buildings in later times. The main structure is made out of concrete, a new invention at the time. The concrete was made from volcanic sand from the bay of Naples, mixed with water. Concrete was poured in wooden frames and therefore could take many shapes. The problem with concrete is it is quite ugly and needs protection from the elements. This is why many of the walls of the Colosseum were covered in marble stones. Of course this marble was later stolen to be reused or to be burned. A lot of marble was burned during the middle ages to make lime, which could be used to fertilize fields.</p>
<p>Can you see the holes outside the building? Many people think there was fighting here during a recent war, but the holes are there because there used to be iron inside them. With these iron hooks the marble was attached to the walls of the building. Later the marble was stolen, and also the iron could be reused.</p>
<p>Before it had four stories, but as you can see only in a small part the four stories are intact. If you would walk around the Colosseum would see that a big part of the outer ring is missing. For a long time the building was used as a stone quarry to provide building materials for the rest of the city. Many churches and palaces were built using stone from the Colosseum, like the Palazzo Farnese. The columns on the outside do not support the building, which is always the case in Greek building. They are just for decoration. Typically roman is the use of the capitals, the top part of the columns. You can see the three Greek orders of capitals above each other. The ground floor has Doric capitals; above that we see Ionian capitals and finally on the 3rd floor you can see Corinthian capitals.</p>
<figure id="attachment_153" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image079.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-153" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image079.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="Ludus Magnus" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ludus Magnus</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you would go up and cross the street you can see the remains of the Ludus Magnus. This was the training complex of the gladiators. It was connected to the Colosseum by an underground passageway.</p>
<figure id="attachment_154" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image080.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-154" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image080.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="Velarium" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Velarium</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you walk to the other side of the Colosseum you can see stones standing up next to it. These stones were used to tie ropes to. The Colosseum could be closed off to protect people from the sun and rain. The sunscreen was tied to these stones here. There always was a team of 100 sailors ready to close the arena with what they called the Velarium. If you ever have experienced the hot sun in august in Rome, you can imagine this was a necessity.</p>
<figure id="attachment_155" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image081.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-155" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image081.jpg?resize=300%2C132" alt="Gladiators" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Gladiators</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, what kind of games where played in the Colosseum? The fights of the gladiators were to most important part of a day at the Colosseum. These fights had a religious origin. Fights were organized at funerals. It was thought that the blood of prisoners could give deceased person strength on his trip to the underworld. But after a while these fights became very commercial. Rich magistrates would finance them to get support from the people. So after a few centuries the fights lost their religious context and became mass spectacles.</p>
<p>There were four schools for gladiators, which were called ludus in Latin. They had space for 2000 gladiators each. The gladiators were well treated because they were very valuable. First most of them were slaves or prisoners of war, but later a lot of people volunteered. If you were poor and a good fighter you could become famous and rich by risking your life in the arena. Gladiators could be stars like modern athletes.</p>
<p>A day in the Colosseum would start with hunting games. Many animals from all over the empire and further away died in the Colosseum. When the Popes had the Colosseum cleaned and proclaimed a holy place, because of all the Christians that died there, a lot of very strange plants that did not grow in Italy were found. These came from the animal droppings. Many animals became extinct because of the Romans love for hunting games, like the North African elephant. When the Colosseum was opened in the year 80 during the reign of Emperor Titus, Vespasian’s son, 900 wild animals were killed during 100 days. Below the arena there was a system of cages and cranes, which could make animals suddenly appear in the arena.</p>
<p>Do you know where the word arena comes from? Arena means sand, as it still does in Spanish. The arena was filled with sand to catch the blood of the animals and fighters.</p>
<p>The Colosseum was free and everybody could visit it. It had 80 entrances and if you walk around the Colosseum you can see numbers above every entrance. You would get a terracotta ticket with the number of you entrance and the number of your seat. It was a very efficient system. In 15 minutes everybody could enter or leave, which is impressing considering 50.000 people could fit in it.</p>
<p>Then, after the hunting games, there would be an intermission in which sometimes prisoners were executed. Many Christians died this way. The problem the romans had with the Christians was the fact that they recognized only one god.  The romans considered the Emperor also a god. So Christians refused to pay the proper respect to the Emperor and the other state gods and this was considered like treason. So many Christians died in here and that is why it is now a holy place. Every year on Good Friday the Pope comes here to remember them.</p>
