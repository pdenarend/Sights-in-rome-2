				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are now standing in the Cortile della Pigna, It is of course named after that big bronze pine cone that used to stand somewhere in the medieval city before it was moved here. It dates back the 2nd century AD and was used as a water fountain (see the difference in color on the top). The base below it came from the ancient Roman baths of Septimus Severus and dates back to 2ad as well.</p>
<p>The 2 peacocks on the sides came from Hadrian’s Villa in Tivoli (a very nice place for a day trip) they also date back to the 2nd century. Peacocks always represent immortality, because it was believed that the flesh from the peacock did not rot after death. This courtyard was used for parties and receptions. In the time of the Borgia Pope (Alexander VI)bullfights were held here. Once an Elephant lived here as well (he was a gift to the Pope).</p>

<figure id="attachment_236" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image159.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-236" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image159.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="The Globe in the Cortile della Pigna" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Globe in the Cortile della Pigna</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the middle of the courtyard, you can see an enormous Globe. It was a gift to John Paul II in 1990 from a famous Italian artist named Arnaldo Pomodoro, which means tomato in Italian. It has two spheres. It is said it represents the Vatican as its own world inside the rest of the world. Both spheres were able to move, but the inside one is broken now and is stuck and cannot be fixed without destroying the whole thing.</p>
<p>On the courtyard you can also see an enormous head. This is an ancient statue of the first Emperor Augustus. The hair was added in the 17th century. This was often done in those times. If a statue was found missing something they just hired an artist to complete it. So in this museum often you will see an ancient statue with a new nose or new hairdo. This one is a bit extreme because this hair is obviously nothing like Augustus’ hair.</p>
<figure id="attachment_237" style="width: 200px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image160.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-237" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image160.jpg?resize=200%2C300" alt="Ancient Statues" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ancient Statues</figcaption></figure>
<p>When you continue your visit on the other side of the courtyard you will see a huge collection of ancient busts and statues. They mostly represent Emperors, noblemen like senators and gods. They were all found around Rome and are heavily restored. You can walk through the gallery to have a look if you want, but the most important statues are located to your left. Look at the decoration next to the stairs in the picture above.</p>
<p>This style of fresco painting has a very famous name. This style became popular at the end of the 15th century. A boy was walking on Esquiline hill and suddenly fell in a hole. He found himself in a strange cave (grotto in Italian) filled with beautiful frescos. It later turned out that the caves once were Emperor Nero’s golden house. The style of wall decoration found in the caves became very popular and the style became known as Grotesque, from the Italian grotto for cave.</p>
<p>On top of the stairs you will see a basin and if you look to your right out the window you will have a nice view of Rome. From here you can see the dome of the pantheon if you look closely and further away the mountains of the Castelli Romani where the Pope has his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo. The palace there is also Vatican territory.</p>
