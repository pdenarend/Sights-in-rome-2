				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The St. John Lateran is one of the most important churches in Rome. The area on which it is built once belonged to the Lateran family. Their property was confiscated because they had conspired against Emperor Nero and had sheltered Christians in their home. In the fourth century AD it was given by Emperor Constantine to the Pope, who built a church there. The Popes lived here also until 1305.</p>
<p><span id="more-522"></span></p>
<h2>The Lateran Palace</h2>
<figure id="attachment_289" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image209.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-289" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image209.jpg?resize=300%2C231" alt="Lateran Palace" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Lateran Palace</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Lateran Palace is attached to the church. It was built in 1586 and designed by Domenico Fontana. The Popes used to live on this spot before they moved to Avignon in France in the middle ages. When they came back, the Lateran Palace was uninhabitable so they moved to the Vatican. In the 16th century the ruins were taken down and this new palace was built.</p>
<h2>The Cathedral</h2>
<p>The Basilica is the actual church. It is the main cathedral of Rome. Until 1870 all Popes were crowned in this church. Emperor Constantine has personally put the first stone down. There is little left of the original cathedral, thanks to the sack of Rome by the Vandals, an earthquake in the 9th century and two fires in the 14th century. On the facade you can see 12 enormous statues. They are 7 meters high. You can see Christ, John the Baptist, John the evangelist and various Church Fathers. The facade was designed by Alessandro Galilei in 1735.</p>
<h2>The Interior of St. John Lateran</h2>
<p>The interior was designed by the influential baroque artist Borromini in 1646. Borromini was the great rival of Bernini and a very difficult person to work with. His architecture is on a very high aesthetic level though. One day he saw a kid destroying some marble blocks on purpose. He had him beaten up by his workmen who proceeded to kill the boy. The Pope was not pleased, but pardoned Borromini because he needed him to finish the cathedral.</p>
<p>The bronze doors were taken from the Curia, the senate building, on the Forum. The right door was made in the year 2000 by Floriano Bodini and is only opened every 25 years during a holy year. In the vestibule, on the left side, you can see a statue of Emperor Constantine, the founder of the church. It was taken from his bathing houses.</p>
<figure id="attachment_291" style="width: 198px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image211.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-291" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image211.jpg?resize=198%2C300" alt="Nave Statue St. John Lateran" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Nave Statue St. John Lateran</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the nave of the church you can see enormous statues on the left and right. They represent the 12 apostles and were made by students of Bernini. You can recognize the apostles by their attributes. Matthew is holding a money bag, Bartholomew is holding a knife.</p>
<h2>The Ceiling of St. John Lateran</h2>
<figure id="attachment_292" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image212.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-292" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image212.jpg?resize=300%2C223" alt="Ceiling of St. John Lateran" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Ceiling of St. John Lateran</figcaption></figure>
<p>The coffered ceiling is from 1585. You can see many doves, which represent the family crest of Pope Innocent X, who commissioned the interior of the church.</p>
<figure id="attachment_293" style="width: 200px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image213.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-293" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image213.jpg?resize=200%2C300" alt="The Papal Altar" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Papal Altar</figcaption></figure>
<p>The papal altar is placed in a central spot, just like in Saint Peters. Only the Pope can say mass here. You can see a gothic canopy above the altar with 12 frescos from the 14th century. In the two silver busts behind the fence on the canopy the heads of Saint Peter and Paul are being kept. Just before the altar is the tomb of Pope Martin V, the Pope who brought the renaissance to Rome. He was the first Pope to rule alone after a string of rivaling Popes in the late middle ages.</p>
<figure id="attachment_294" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image214.jpg"><img class="wp-image-294 size-medium" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image214.jpg?resize=300%2C250" alt="Fresco's by Cavalier d’Arpino and Apse Mosaic" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fresco&#8217;s by Cavalier d’Arpino and Apse Mosaic</figcaption></figure>
<p>The transept has frescos painted by Cavalier d’Arpino. They were painted around the year 1600 and show episodes from the history of this church. You can see the baptism of Emperor Constantine and the founding of San Giovanni.</p>
<p>The mosaic in the apse represents Christ as a savior. It is from the 4th century and the first public representation of Christ. Legend has it the mosaic of Christ was made by angels. The rest of the mosaic is from the 13th century. To the left of the cross you can see Mary, a Pope, Saint Francis of Assisi, Peter and Paul. To the right you can see John the Baptist, Saint Anthony of Padova, John the evangelist and Andreas the apostle.</p>
