				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Piazza della Repubblica was once part of the huge baths of Diocletian. The half circular shape of the piazza still reflects this. This part used to be the entrance hall to the baths. Parts of the actual baths are still standing on one side of the piazza. Bathing was very important for the ancient Romans and was an important part of everybody’s life. Everybody went to the baths. Men, women, slaves and masters, poor people and very rich. Of course everybody had different hours on which they were allowed to go to the baths. Personal hygiene was very important. The Romans believed in the idea of a healthy mind in a healthy body. Rome had a lot of very imposing baths, because all of the one million people that lived in ancient Rome went to bathe. It was also a place to do business meetings or to meet up with friends. Besides bathing, you could also get a massage, go to the gym or have a relaxing walk in the gardens. Of course, also stories are known of theft, murder and orgies that took place in the baths. In Pompeii archeologists found this inscription: ‘Bathing, wine and sex wreck our body, but what is life without bathing, wine and sex’.</p>

<p>The fountain in the middle of Piazza della Repubblica was made in 1888. You can see the sea god Glaucus and two nymphs. Two famous female singers modeled for the nymphs and the statues caused uproar when their voluptuous bodies were revealed. The two singers continued to visit the fountain until their deaths many years later. Many romans remember the two old ladies sitting next to the fountain, remembering how beautiful they once were.</p>
