				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Temple is the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina. Antoninus is not a very famous Emperor. He was one of the adoptive Emperors. After Emperor Domitian became crazy and was murdered the senate decided that a new system for appointing Emperors had to be found. So they appointed one of their own, Nerva, Emperor. Nerva was not allowed to let his son be Emperor, but he had to adopt a promising young man as his successor. So Nerva adopted Trajan, who became one of the best Emperors, Trajan adopted Hadrian and Hadrian adopted Antoninus Pius. Antoninus is not very famous even though he was a very good Emperor. This is because during his reign nothing happened. The empire was at peace and a lot of people prospered. Antoninus then adopted Marcus Aurelius, who made his son Commodus Emperor. If you have ever seen the movie Gladiator you know that this did not work out very well.</p>

<p>This temple was built by Antoninus for his wife Faustina after she died. After his death it was dedicated to him as well. Emperors were always declared a god after they died. The Emperor who ordered the building of the Colosseum, Vespasian said some famous last words before he died. He said, Oh my, I think I am becoming a God. The building is still standing, unlike most buildings on the forum. This is because it was transformed into a church in the middle ages. In 1602 the building got a baroque facade.</p>
