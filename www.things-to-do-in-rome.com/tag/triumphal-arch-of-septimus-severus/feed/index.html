				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The triumphal arch of Septimus Severus was built in 203 AD in remembrance of his 10 years as Emperor and because of his victory against the Parthians. It was also dedicated to his sons Caracalla and Geta, but when Caracalla became Emperor he had his brother murdered and all references to his brother were taken down from the arch. You can see that there is a hole somewhere in the fourth line of the inscription. This is where Geta’s name could be read. In the middle ages the arch stood half in the earth and a barber shop was run from under there. Caracalla’s real name was Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus Pius Felix but his nickname was Caracalla, which was the name of the Gallic Cape he always wore and made fashionable.</p>

<p>The area in front of the arch used to be the actual Forum, the market square. Only three trees stood here, they were a fig tree, an olive tree and a vine, which symbolized the essential foods of the Romans. Augustus had the forum paved with the travertine stones which you still can see.</p>

<p>Next to the arch is the base of the Umbilicus Urbis. This spot marked the heart of the city, the bellybutton of Rome. You must have heard the expression ‘All roads lead to Rome’. All roads lead to Rome and all those roads would lead to this point.</p>
