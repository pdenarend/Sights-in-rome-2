				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trastevere used to be a popular neighborhood, where typical roman families used to live. This aspect of the neighborhood has disappeared a little. Now many tourists, but also Romans from all over the city come here to have dinner or to drink. It is a fun area and very beautiful. Once, in Roman times, this area was populated by slaves, seamen, Syrians and Jews and lay outside the city walls. This was the place where foreign traders lived. The name means across the Tevere, which is the Italian name for the Tiber. In the picture you can see the Piazza of Santa Maria in Trastevere, the social center of the neighborhood.</p>
