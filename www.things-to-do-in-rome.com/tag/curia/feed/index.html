				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the spot where the senate held its sessions. It once started with 100 senators, but in the time of Caesar there were 900. Emperor Augustus reduced their number to 600. The building burned down in 52 BC in the time of Julius Caesar. He paid for the restoration, but the senate was temporarily moved across town. So Caesar was not murdered on this spot, because at that time the building was being reconstructed. The present building is another reconstruction from the time of Diocletian in the 3rd century. Why do you think it is still standing? This is, as almost always with ancient constructions, because it was transformed into a church. Mussolini then changed it back to how it was before.</p>

<p>The senators sat on seats that were placed on the long side. Inside the Curia you can see Emperor Trajanâ€™s Plutei, fragments of the old stage in front of the Curia. On it you can a carving of the so called Suovetaurilia. This was a sacrifice in which a pig (sus), a sheep (ovis) and a bull (taurus) were offered. The bronze doors are copies, but the original ones still exist. Architect Borromini moved them to Saint John in Lateran, where they still are.</p>
<p>The paved space in front of the Curia was the Comitium. The people of Rome would meet here to hold important meetings. Here, a long time ago, stood the Ficus Ruminalis. This was the fig tree on which the casket with Romulus and Remus had stopped while they were floating down the Tiber (remember the forum was a swamp before, connected to the river).</p>
