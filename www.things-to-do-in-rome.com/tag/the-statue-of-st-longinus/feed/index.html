				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Around the baldacchino in St. Peter&#8217;s are four sculptures in the pillars that support the Dome. Relics of these four Saints are kept inside the pillars. The first we see is Saint Longinus, which was sculpted by Bernini. He is the Roman soldier that put his spear in the side of Christ when he was on the cross. Right when Longinus did this he was struck by light and realized Christ was truly God’s son. He then converted and became a Saint. We see him here just after he realized Christ was truly God’s son. He is struck by light, and of course here the light is also present. It comes from the dome above him. The original spear was donated to the Vatican and it’s kept in above the statue, behind the doors on the balcony.</p>
