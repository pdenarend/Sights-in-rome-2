				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Between Trastevere and the ghetto lies the Tiber Island, the isola Tiberina. In Roman times, the Temple of Asclepius was here. He was the god of medicine and so talented he could raise people from the dead. His daughters were called Hygieia and Panacea. If you were sick you would go to the temple of Asclepius. You would sleep there, and if you saw a snake in your dream you would have been healed.</p>
<p>Later a hospital for people suffering from the plague was here. This way the patients could be put in quarantine. Even nowadays there is a hospital on the island. It a tradition that is older than 2000 years. Quite amazing!</p>
<p>According to legend, the island was created when the Romans threw the grain supply of the last King of Rome, Tarquinius Superbus, in the river when they deposed him and founded the republic. Earth was thrown on top of the grain and the many seeds created the island. In reality the island is of volcanic origin.</p>

<p>To the south of the island stands the Ponte Rotto, the broken bridge. It was built in 142 BC and it was the first stone bridge that crossed the Tiber. It was also the first arched bridge in the world. It was destroyed by a flood somewhere in the 16th century but the middle part still stands in the water.</p>
