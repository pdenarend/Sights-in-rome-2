				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here you can see the Forum of Trajan. Much of this amazing complex is still standing. Trajan was the first Emperor that was not from Rome. He was born in Spain, but from a family of Roman colonists. He was a promising young general when he was adopted by Emperor Nerva. He was a great strategist and won many wars. He conquered the Dacians, whom we now call the Romanians. He is the reason the Romanians still speak a Romance language and so many Romanians come to Italy to look for work. It is very easy for them to learn Italian.</p>
<p>Trajan also builds a lot of public buildings, like Vespasian and Titus before him. They also did not build a lot of buildings for themselves, because they wanted to consolidate their reign by pleasing the public.</p>
<figure id="attachment_165" style="width: 225px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image091.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-165" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image091.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="Trajan's Column" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Trajan&#8217;s Column</figcaption></figure>
<p>Trajan’s forum was finished in 113. He paid for it with the money he made conquering the Dacians. The territory of the Dacians was filled with gold mines. He wanted to build the most impressive of Imperial Forums. His architect was the Apollodorus of Damascus, the most famous architect of that time. The most famous monument on his Forum is still standing. It is Trajan’s Column. On the column you can see the story of Trajan’s conquest of the Dacians in a spiral bas relief. Once the column was painted in bright colors, but now it is just white. It is almost 40 meters high (131 feet). The bas relief tells the story of Trajan’s victory. It is a very interesting source for historians. You can see the Romans build bridges, set up camp and engaging in battle, all in a very realistic style. There are about 2500 figures visible and they are all of high artistic quality. Inside there are stairs which lead to the top.</p>
<p>On top there is now a statue of Saint Peter, which was put there to show Christianity goes above paganism. Originally there was a statue of Trajan there. After Trajan died, his ashes were held in a golden urn at the base of the column. According to a Roman legend, Trajan made it to heaven in the end, although he was never Christian. When Pope Gregory I the great visited the forum in the 6th century he looked at the column and saw a picture of Trajan comforting a woman who had lost her son. Gregory was deeply touched that he prayed for the soul of the deceased Emperor. His prayers were answered because he managed to bring the ashes temporarily back to life. He then baptized Trajan who could then enter heaven. The column is probably still standing because it was used as a bell tower for a medieval church, which now has long disappeared.</p>
<p>Behind the column you can see the actual forum. It was an enormous market and is still standing. It was basically a shopping mall. There were 150 shops on 6 floors. It is made out of brick, which had just been discovered. Downstairs probably dry foods like sugar and flour were sold and you could go upstairs to buy oil and wine. The medieval tower behind the forum is from the 13th century and is called the Torre delle Milizie. Soldiers were based here.</p>
