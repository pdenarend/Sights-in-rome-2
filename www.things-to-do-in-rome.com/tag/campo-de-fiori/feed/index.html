				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This square is called Campo de’ Fiori, the field of flowers. Until 1431 this was a field where flowers grew. It was also the place where public executions were held. The names of the small streets surrounding Campo still refer to this. Vicolo de Venti refers to the 20 (venti) heretics that were thrown in hot oil here. Via della Corda means Street of the Rope which refers to the Gallows.</p>

<p>The statue in the middle of the Square represents Giordano Bruno, a philosopher and Dominican monk who was put to death by the Catholic Church for his beliefs. He claimed the earth was not the center of the universe and that stars are suns that are spread out throughout the galaxy. The statue was put here in 1887, when the Popes had stopped ruling all of Rome. In the medallions we see portraits of eight other heretics that had to die for their beliefs.</p>
<p>Vanozza Catanei used to run a few inns on campo. She was the lover of Rodrigo Borgia who became Pope Alexander VI. She had four children by the Pope, of which Lucrezia and Cesare Borgia are the most famous.</p>
<p>Campo is one of the centers of Roman nightlife. During the day this is a market, but in the evening the square is filled with a mix of young Italians and tourists who hang outside or in the bars. It is very nice to spend an evening here. It is more authentic than Piazza Navona, which is touristy and expensive.</p>
