				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have time try to go and see the Baptistery. It is a small building just outside St. John Lateran. It is the oldest of Rome and according to legend this is the place Emperor Constantine would have been baptized by Pope Sylvester I. The current building dates from 432. Its octagonal shape would influence the building of all later Baptisteries all over the world. The octagonal shape represents the 8th day of creation, when a man is created again by being baptized. It is built on the baths of the old house of Faustina, the second wife of Constantine. The basin is an old roman bathtub made from green basalt. The basin had to be big, because in this time adults were converted to Christianity and had to be baptized by submerging their whole body in water.</p>
<p>You can see frescoes with scenes from the life of John the Baptist and also scenes from the life of Constantine. The mosaic is from the 5th century. The deer represents the renewal of life. The deer blows water towards snakes in holes in the earth to get them out and trample them, just like god uses water to baptize people and drive out evil. The deer always looks for water to drink which represents humanities need for baptism.</p>
