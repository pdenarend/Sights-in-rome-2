				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Vatican museums are 14 kilometers long and there are about 2000 rooms in the museum. It is said that if you spend 60 seconds looking at every item in the museum you will spend 12 years in here.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that the spaces you will walk through were never built as a museum. They were the private quarters of the Pope. So the museum is one direction only, just because some passageways are so small.</p>
<p>The founder of the museum was one of the most influential Popeâ€™s. His name was Julius II. In 1506 a statue was found on Esquiline hill. Julius sent Michelangelo to examine it and on his recommendation he immediately bought it. He put it on display in the Vatican for all to see. The statue is still there and you will see it later. It is still one of the highlights of the museum.</p>
