				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The San Luigi dei Francesi is the national church of France in Rome. It was designed by Giacomo della Porta and executed by Domenico Fontana between 1518 and 1589. The facade has several statues with famous people from the history of France, like Charlemagne, Saint Louis, Saint Clothilde and Saint Jeanne of Valois.</p>
<p>Inside is one of the masterpieces of Domenichino, a famous baroque painter. On the ceiling he painted the histories of Saint Cecilia. Domenichino was for a period considered one of the best painters of all time, but his fame is somewhat diminished now.</p>

<p>The church is most famous though for the three canvases painted by Caravaggio in the Contarelli Chapel. You can find these on in the chapel on the far left side.</p>

<p>They are ‘The calling of Saint Matthew’, one of Caravaggio’s absolute masterpieces, ‘The inspiration of Saint Matthew’ and ‘The martyrdom of Saint Matthew’. Caravaggio’s real name was Michelangelo Merisi, but he came from the town of Caravaggio, which explains his nickname. He was a very original painter. He was amazing in the depiction of light and dark. His subjects all look like contemporary people and he often used people he met in bars to pose for him. They always look poor and often have dirty nails. Caravaggio believed that Jesus and his apostles were also just normal people and not rich, so he painted them like that. This was often misunderstood in Caravaggio’s time. Caravaggio did not get along with his patrons and was often found in the pubs around town. Once, during a brawl, he killed someone and had to flee Rome, never to return.</p>
<p>Look at the calling of Saint Matthew, it is a true masterpiece. Jesus is in the dark, on the right side and points to Matthew who looks up from his game surprised and points at himself, like he is saying ‘Me?’ See how the light emanates from Jesus and falls on Matthews face.</p>
