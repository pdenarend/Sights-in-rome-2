				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the left wall of the gallery of the Tapestries you can see tapestries representing the life of Christ. They are based on designs by the school of Raphael, but they were woven in Flanders, where the best weaver could be found. They were commissioned by Clement VII in the 1500’s. The ones on the right tell the life of Urban VIII. He was a Pope from the Barberini family. These tapestries were woven here in Rome and you can see the difference in quality. Clearly the Flemish weavers were a lot better at weaving.</p>
<p>It would take 9 years to finish just one tapestry. They are made out of the most precious materials like gold thread, silk, silver thread and wool. They were not only made to decorate walls but also to keep out the heat or the cold in summer or winter. They would give extra isolation. We will concentrate on the tapestries on the left because they are the most interesting.</p>
<p><span id="more-703"></span></p>
<p>The first tapestry on the left depicts the birth of Jesus.</p>
<p>The next one is more interesting because it depicts baby Jesus being circumcised by a Pope.  Of course no Popes existed back then.</p>
<p>While you pass the tapestries do not forget to look up. The ceilings look like they are carved, but they are not. They are painted. It is a technique called Chiaroscuro. The artist paints shadows to make his painting three-dimensional. They were painted in 1789 by Domenico Del Frate and Antonio Marini and depict allegorical scenes celebrating the glory of the reigning Pope, Pius VI.</p>
<p>Then there is a Transfiguration. Jesus shows his true godly nature to 3 apostles. He begins to shine with white bright light and then Moses and Elijah appear next to him. Then a voice from the sky calls him son.</p>
<p>The next three tapestries depict the massacre of the innocents. It is a depiction of a horrible story. King Herod ordered the killing of all the babies in Bethlehem because he heard from the three kings that a new king of the Jews was born there.</p>
<p>The next tapestry represents the resurrection of Christ. This is the most famous tapestry. As you walk past it you have to keep on looking into the eyes of Christ. You will see that he looks at you from every angle. This is of course symbolic. Christ watches over you. The effect is really well done. The technique was used in painting more often, like in Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, but to create the same effect in tapestry is very difficult. It involves a complex system of cross-stitching.</p>
<p>The last two tapestries on your left before you enter the next Gallery are different. They do not depict the life of Christ, but scenes from Roman times. The last one is the most interesting. Here we see the murder of Julius Caesar by 60 senators. This happened on the Ides of March in 44 BC, which is the 15th of March. The senators were afraid that Caesar wanted to become king. At that time Rome was a republic, but Caesar had been ruling as a Dictator for many years. The senators wanted Rome to stay a republic, but unfortunately for them after the murder, Caesar’s adopted son Octavian won a civil war and became the first Imperator, or Emperor and took the name Augustus. This was the end of the republic system and the start of the Roman Empire.</p>
