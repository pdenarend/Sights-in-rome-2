				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The next room from the Round Room is called the room of the Greek cross. It was also designed by Michelangelo Simonetti in 1780. If you look behind you next to the door you can see two Egyptian statues. They are not real Egyptian, but roman fake Egyptian. They were made for Emperor Hadrian’s villa in Tivoli and that is where they were found.</p>
<p>The two sarcophagi date are from the 4th century AD and are made are porphyry, the same material as Nero’s bathtub in the last room. Look at them. One was meant for Emperor Constantine&#8217;s father and one was meant for his daughter. Which one is which do you think? Clearly the one with the angel-like figures and vines was made for his daughter and the one with the warriors on horseback was made for his father. Constantine was a very important Emperor, maybe the most influential of them all, because it was Constantine who made the empire Christian and it was Constantine who built the first Saint Peter’s Basilica.</p>

<p>The mosaic in the middle represents Pallas Athena and is from the 3rd century AD. She is the goddess of wisdom, courage and justice.</p>
<p>The two sphinxes also came from Hadrian’s villa and are not Egyptian but Roman.</p>
