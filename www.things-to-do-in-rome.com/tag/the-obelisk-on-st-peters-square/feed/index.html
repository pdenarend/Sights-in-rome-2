				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The obelisk on St. Peter&#8217;s Square is 25 meters high, made from red granite. Emperor Caligula ordered to be erected around here. It came from Egypt, where it was created under the pharaoh’s. The Romans really liked all things Egyptian. We have to realise that the Egyptian culture was already 2000 years old in the time of Julius Caesar. People like him looked to the ancient Egyptians like we look to the Romans now. The Romans loved the obelisks of Egypt so much, that many of them were taken from Egypt to Rome. Now, there are more obelisks in Rome than in the whole of Egypt.</p>
<p>A special ship was made to transport this one from Egypt to Rome. On the pedestal it says Caligula dedicated it to his predecessors Augustus and Tiberius. It was placed on the square in 1586 during the Papacy of Sixtus V, who was obsessed by obelisks. He had them excavated all over town and resurrected. He had workers go around the city with long metal sticks to poke the earth around places where it was suspected obelisks could be found.</p>
<p>When this one was raised, none of the workers was allowed to speak, because they all had to be able to hear the instructions. The punishment for speaking was death, but when the obelisk was halfway up a sailor screamed ‘put water on the ropes’. He was not punished but rewarded because if this had not happened the ropes would have snapped and the obelisk would have fallen down.</p>
