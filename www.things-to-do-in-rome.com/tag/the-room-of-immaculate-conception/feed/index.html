				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This room in the Vatican is called the Room of Immaculate Conception. This room is situated on what was once the Borgia Tower. The Frescos here were painted by Francesco Podesti in the 19th century. They show scenes from the proclamation of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception by Pope Pius IX in 1854.</p>
<p>The doctrine refers to the conception of the Virgin Mary in the womb of her mother Anne. According to the doctrine Anne’s womb was without sin and so the Virgin Mary was born free of original sin and therefore Christ was born free of sin. The document was proclaimed Ex Cathedra. When a dogma is proclaimed ex cathedra it can no longer be changed. This was the last time a dogma was proclaimed Ex Cathedra. The papal bull was sent to every country in the world and as was the custom the countries sent it back to the Vatican translated into their own language. These documents are kept in this beautiful cabinet which was made in Paris.</p>
