				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Piazza Venezia is the heart of Rome. It is named after the Palazzo that stands next to it, which was built in 1455 by a cardinal, Pietro Barbo, from Venice. He later became Pope Paul II. Most of its fame derives from the fact that Mussolini had his offices here and often held speeches from the balcony. He always kept the lights on, even when he was not there, to show he was working hard for the Italian people.</p>
<figure id="attachment_128" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image054.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-128" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image054.jpg?resize=300%2C199" alt="The Vittoriano" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Vittoriano</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course the most impressive building here is the Monument for Victor Emanuel II, the first king of Italy. Italy only exists as a country since 1870, before this the peninsula was divided into a lot of small states. When Italy became united it was felt that an appropriate monument should be erected. This monument was meant as a counterpart to Saint Peter’s. The Italians felt that their capital should not only have an enormous monument to the church, but also a monument to their new fatherland. Unfortunately, the design did not please the Romans. They call it the wedding cake or the typewriter. The monument was finished in 1911 and since 1921 the grave of the Unknown Soldier is also here. The fountain to the left represents the Tyrrhenian Sea and the one on the right the Adriatic Sea. On the top are the triumphal chariots of unity and freedom, and of course, in the middle, you can see Victor Emanuel on his horse.</p>
<p>You can go up the stairs and in the building is a free museum about the Risorgimento, the unification of Italy. On the back of the building you can find an elevator. If you pay the ticket it will take you to the top of the building where you have an amazing view of the city.</p>
