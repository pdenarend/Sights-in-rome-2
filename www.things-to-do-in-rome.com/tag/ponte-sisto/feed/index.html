				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ponte Sisto was built in 1475 during the papacy of Sixtus IV, the same Pope who gave his name to the Sistine Chapel. During the holy year of 1450 the Ponte Sant’Angelo had not been able to accommodate all the pilgrims so a new bridge was made. Now it is a nice pedestrian bridge leading to the Trastevere neighborhood. Trastevere is a good place to find a restaurant or bar. It is beautiful during the day, but really comes to live at night. Friday and Saturday nights the streets are filled with both tourists and Italians.</p>
