				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This church, adjacent to the Pantheon, is the only Gothic church in Rome. It is called Santa Maria Sopra Minerva. Sopra means above, so the church was built on top of a temple dedicated to Minerva. Churches were often built on top of temples. After Christianity replaced paganism, the temples were no longer needed and were considered blasphemous. So they were torn down and with the building material recovered churches were built.</p>
<p>The facade is simple and dates from the renaissance, but the interior of the church is gothic. The gothic style was never very popular in Italy and at the time of the style’s popularity the Popes lived in Avignon in France, so not much was built in Rome at that time. The church belongs to the Dominican friars. On the right side on the facade markers can be seen which show how high the water would rise sometimes. This area was prone to flooding until the banks of the Tiber were strengthened in the 19th century.</p>

<h2>Interior of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva</h2>
<figure id="attachment_303" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image223.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-303" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image223.jpg?resize=600%2C800" alt="Interior of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Interior of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva</figcaption></figure>
<p>Inside the church, an early work of Michelangelo can be seen. It is a statue representing the resurrected Christ and you can see it to the left of the altar. On the other side is a Christ on the cross, which was started by Michelangelo, but finished by another artist.</p>
<h2>The grave of Saint Catharine of Siena</h2>
<figure id="attachment_305" style="width: 603px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image225.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-305" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image225.jpg?resize=603%2C390" alt="The grave of Saint Catharine of Siena" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The grave of Saint Catharine of Siena</figcaption></figure>
<p>The grave of Saint Catharine of Siena is also inside the church. She was a Dominican nun and lived in the 14th century. She played a very big part in the return of the Pope to Rome. The Popes were living in Avignon in France at the time and she wrote them letters to convince them to come back to Rome. She also took care of lepers and the poor in the city and received stigmata, the wounds of Christ, just like Saint Francis. She died when she was 33, just like Christ. She was proclaimed patron Saint of Rome, together with Saint Francis.</p>
<h2>The grave of Fra Angelico</h2>
<figure id="attachment_306" style="width: 341px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image226.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-306" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image226.jpg?resize=341%2C455" alt="The grave of Fra Angelico" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The grave of Fra Angelico</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the floor of the chapel on the left of the main altar, you can find the grave of renaissance painter Fra Angelico, who died in the monastery next to the church in 1455.</p>
<h2>Carafa Chapel</h2>
<figure id="attachment_307" style="width: 404px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image227.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-307" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image227.jpg?resize=404%2C606" alt="Carafa Chapel" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Carafa Chapel</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the Carafa Chapel at the end of the right transept you can see frescos by Filippino Lippi with the life of Thomas of Aquino, who was a Dominican monk and Church father. Filippino was the son of famous renaissance painter Fra Filippo Lippi, who was a monk, but not a very good one. He married a nun and fathered Filipino, who became a very good painter himself as well, as you can see. Two Medici Popes (Clement VII and Leo X) are buried in the church as well in tombs made by Antonio da Sangallo. On the left side is also the tomb of Paul IV, the Pope responsible for locking the Roman Jews up in the Ghetto.</p>
