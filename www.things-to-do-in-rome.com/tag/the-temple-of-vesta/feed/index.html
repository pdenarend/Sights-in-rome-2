				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Maybe you already noticed the Temple of Vesta. It is a small, round temple, that is still partially standing. In this temple the Vestal Virgins always kept a ceremonial flame burning. This flame was brought to Rome by Aeneas from Troy, the Romans believed. In their house, just behind the temple they also kept pure water. People that lived in Rome always could go to see the Vestal Virgins if they needed water or fire. When Rome was just a very small settlement the Vestal virgins already existed. They lived in a small wooden temple on palatine hill, which was also round, and provided the same service for the people of the village. The fire was once a year extinguished and started again by the Pontifex Maximus, the highest priest of the Roman empire. He was the only man who was allowed to enter the house. Inside the house you can still see some names of the virgins on the pedestals on which statues once stood.</p>
<p><span id="more-591"></span></p>
<p>The Pontifex Maximus chose 6 virgins. They were girls from patrician families and were between 6 and 10 years old. After they joined the virgins their hair was cut and they were dressed in white. They then had to learn how to perform their duties for 10 years, then they had to serve for ten years and the last ten years they had to teach the new girls how to be Vestal Virgins. After these 30 years they were free. They were not allowed any sexual contact. If they did, they were put to death by being buried alive. In the history of Rome this happened only 10 times. But after the 30 years of service the Virgins were free and could also choose to lose their virginity if they wanted to, but most women preferred to stay alone, because they were used to being free. Women had very little rights when married.</p>
<p>The foundations of their house are still intact. This kind of building would later be used in the building of monasteries. You can see a courtyard; with around it cells where the Vestal virgins would live. In the middle was the basin where the pure water was held.</p>
