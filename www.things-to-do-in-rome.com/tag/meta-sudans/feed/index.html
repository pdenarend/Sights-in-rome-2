				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Meta Sudans was the fountain where the victorious gladiators would wash the blood and sand from their bodies. The base of the Meta Sudans can be seen in the above picture in the brown circular region just in front of the arch. Italian dictator Mussolini had most of it removed because it was standing in his way. He needed the space for military parades. You can see the remains of the Meta Sudans in the right lower corner of the picture above. There is not much to see.</p>
