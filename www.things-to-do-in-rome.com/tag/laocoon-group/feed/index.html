				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The most important statue in the Octagonal Courtyard is the Laocoön Group. It dates back to the first century AD, but the original Greek bronze dated back to 2bc. The original is once again lost.  It is called a monolithic statue, because it is made from one single block of marble. It was sculpted by three artists from Rhodes.</p>
<p>It represents a Trojan Priest. Do you remember the story of the Trojan War? The Trojan prince Paris declared Venus to be the most beautiful of all goddesses and therefore she allowed him to marry the most beautiful girl in the world. Unfortunately this was Helen, the wife of Menelaus, king of Sparta. Paris kidnapped her and took her to Troy and so the Greek started a war. This war lasted for ten years and was only decided by a trick by Odysseus, a famous Greek hero.</p>
<p><span id="more-691"></span></p>
<p>One morning the Greek left the beach where they were based and just left an enormous wooden horse in front of the gate of Troy. Of course the Trojans did not know what to do with this horse. What would you do if you woke up one morning and a wooden horse was standing in your doorstep? So they debated and one priest did not like the horse. He had a premonition. He warned the Trojans not to take in the horse. But then to snakes came from the sea and devoured him and his sons. The Trojans thought this meant the gods wanted them to take in the horse. So they did and in the night the Greek warriors came out of the belly of the horse, opened the city gate and Troy was destroyed.</p>
<p>It is an amazing statue. You can see fear and pain in their expressions. Even in antiquity this was a very famous piece. It was lost for many years but then it was found again in 1506 on Esquiline hill. Pope Julius II bought it immediately and brought it here. The right arm of the statue was missing so Michelangelo made a new one. Then centuries later, in 1905, the original arm was found in an antique shop. You can still see Michelangelo’s arm in the photo in front of the statue.</p>
<p>After this statue was found, it had an enormous influence on later artists. You can notice, looking at other statues in this courtyard, that there is a lot more emotion and movement in this statue. So centuries after it was made it was a major influence on the development of baroque sculpture.</p>
