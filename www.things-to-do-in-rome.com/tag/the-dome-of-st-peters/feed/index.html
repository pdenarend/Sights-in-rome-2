				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you look up in the middle of Saint Peter&#8217;s, you can see Michelangelo’s dome. It is a beautiful piece of architecture. His idea was to make a dome like the Pantheon’s, but lift it up on pillars, and that is exactly what we see. He himself thought the dome of his native Florence was more beautiful and he made the diameter of his dome half a meter shorter than that of the Pantheon, in honor of the unknown architect of that building. The word around the dome say in Latin ‘Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam et tibi dabo claves regni caelorum‘: You are Peter and upon this rock I will build My Church and I will give you the keys to heaven’, the famous sentence Jesus said and on which the Popes base their authority as successors of Saint Peter, who of course is considered the first Pope. The dome weighs 56 million kilograms and is 136.5 meter high, which is 447.8 feet. You can climb the dome. The entrance is outside the Church on the right side, looking from the square.</p>

<p>Under the dome we can see the Confessio and the Papal altar. The confessio is where Saint Peter is buried. You cannot see his grave from here, but it is supposed to be behind the niche in the back, right under the dome. The Pallium is kept here. This is a circular band of white wool which the Pope places on the shoulders of each newly appointed Archbishop on June 29, the feast of Saint Peter and Paul. The wool comes from sheep that are blessed by the Pope on the day of Saint Agnes. Above is the Papal Altar, which only the Pope may use. It is one piece of marble that came from Roman times. From here, the Pope says mass only twice a year, on Christmas and Easter. These oil candles are always lit in honor of St Peter.</p>
