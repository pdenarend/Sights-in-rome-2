				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The church on the island is dedicated to St. Bartholomew, one of the apostles of Jesus. It was built around the year 1000 and a few centuries later the remains of the apostle Bartholomew were brought to the church, after which it was dedicated to him. His remains are buried below the main altar and the plate on which the remains were brought here can be seen on the right next to the altar. Michelangelo painted Bartholomew in his fresco of the last judgment in the Sistine Chapel. He is the one holding his own skin in his hand, because he was skinned alive.</p>

<p>In front of the church is the Colonna Infame. On this column, every year on August the 24th, the names of the people who had not observed communion during Easter were written down here for everyone to see. Fortunately, this tradition is discontinued.</p>
