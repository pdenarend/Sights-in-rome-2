				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The San Clemente is one of the most interesting churches in Rome. It consists of three layers. Under the main church from the 12th century you can find another church from the 4th century and under that there is an old roman house with a sanctuary to Mithras. The first church on the middle level was erected in the 4th century and named after the 4th Pope Saint Clement, who used to live on this spot. This church was partly destroyed in the 11th century by a Norman conqueror and then a new church was built on top of the remains of the others.</p>
<p>Clement was banished to the Crimea by the Romans because of his success in converting people to Christianity, but even from there he kept on converting lots of people. He then was given an ultimatum: Or worship the Roman gods or die. He decided to continue converting and was then thrown into the Black sea, tied to an anchor. Afterwards, the sea would open once a year, so people could erect a shrine and worship Clements relics. On one of these occasions a widow lost her only son, but he was found alive and well a year later when the sea opened again.</p>

<figure id="attachment_327" style="width: 627px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image245.jpg"><img class="wp-image-327 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image245.jpg?resize=627%2C836" alt="Interior of the San Clemente" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Interior of the San Clemente</figcaption></figure>
<p>The columns in the nave of the upper church came from the Forum Romanum. They were taken from other buildings and reused here. This happened often in the middle ages.</p>
<p>You can also see a Schola Cantorum, which divides the choir from the rest of the church. This is actually a structure from the 6th century and precedes the upper church. You can see typical early Christian motives like fish, doves and vines.</p>
<h2>Mosaics in the San Clemente</h2>
<figure id="attachment_328" style="width: 624px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image246.jpg"><img class="wp-image-328 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image246.jpg?resize=624%2C461" alt="Mosaics in the San Clemente" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Mosaics in the San Clemente</figcaption></figure>
<p>There is a mosaic on the triumphal arch above the altar from the 12th century. In the upper right corner you can see Clement with an anchor. The remains of Clement and the anchor were transported to this church in the 9th century. On the left you can see the apostle Paul together with Saint Lawrence.</p>
<p>The mosaic on the apse depicts the triumph of the cross. You can see the tree of life. The twelve doves on the cross symbolizes the twelve apostles, just like the twelve sheep below. Around them you can see the people that work in the vineyard of the lord surrounded by monks, slaves, sheep, peacocks, which symbolizes immortality, and birdcages.</p>
<h2>Chapel of Saint Catherine of Alexandria</h2>
<figure id="attachment_329" style="width: 624px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image247.jpg"><img class="wp-image-329 size-full" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image247.jpg?resize=624%2C468" alt="Chapel of Saint Catherine of Alexandria" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Chapel of Saint Catherine of Alexandria</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the chapel of Saint Catherine of Alexandria you can see a fresco by Masolino da Panicale from Florence. Catherine was the daughter of an Egyptian king who refused to marry Emperor Maxentius, because she was a Christian (and he was not). Maxentius cannot get her to worship the roman gods, even after he sends pagan priest and philosophers to convince her. She converts them instead. The Emperor then condemned them to be burned alive. Catharina then criticizes Maxentius because of this, who then condemns her to death by starvation. In the prison a pigeon brings Catharina food. She is then tortured on a wheel with sharp pins, but the wheel broke. Then she was decapitated and from her wounds milk flowed instead of blood.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first scene depicts the dispute between Catharina and the pagan priests.</li>
<li>The second scene shows Catherine’s missionary work.</li>
<li>Here she converted Maxentius’ wife.</li>
<li>In the next scene she is rescued by an angel while being tortured on the wheel.</li>
<li>The last scene depicts her decapitation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Lower Church</h2>
<p>After you buy a ticket you can visit the Lower Church. This church was built in the 4th century. You can see inscriptions from pagan times and from Christian times. You can also see the remains of some 11th century frescos. Stories from the life of Clement are depicted, like the story of the boy who stayed a year under the sea and was unharmed, because Clement protected him.</p>
<figure id="attachment_330" style="width: 622px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image248.jpg"><img class="wp-image-330 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image248.jpg?resize=622%2C358" alt="Fresco of Saint Alessio" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fresco of Saint Alessio</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the nave you can see some more damaged frescoes from the 9th century. You can see Pope Leo IV and also the legend of Saint Alessio, who left his bride on his wedding night to go on a pilgrimage. When he came back, nobody recognized him and he lived like a beggar under the stairs of his parental home. Only after his death a Pope recognized him in a dream.</p>
<p>On the left side you pass the grave of Saint Cyrillus, the apostle of the Slavic people. He created the Slavic or Cyrillic alphabet, to properly translate the bible into the Slavic languages. It was he who gave the remains of Saint clement to the church and that is why his is buried here. Often Greek-Orthodox priests or monks visit his grave.</p>
<h2>Roman House with Mithraeum</h2>
<figure id="attachment_331" style="width: 622px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image249.jpg"><img class="wp-image-331 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image249.jpg?resize=622%2C413" alt="Mithraeum under San Clemente" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Mithraeum under San Clemente</figcaption></figure>
<p>After you pass the grave you can enter the third level. Below the lower church is an ancient Mithraeum. The cult of Mithras was very popular in Rome and was a big rival of the new Christian cult. It was very popular under Roman legionnaires. Mithras was always worshipped in a natural cave with a ceiling representing heaven. In the ceiling you can see 11 holes, representing 7 planets and 4 seasons. Mithras was born from a rock on the 25th of December. It is interesting to know that the cult of Mithras is older than Christianity. Some shepherds were present at his birth. Apollo, the god of light told Mithras to kill the cosmic bull, to save humanity. When Mithras was fighting the bull the god of evil sent a snake and a scorpion, who bit the bull in his testicles to prevent him from procreating. All animal and plant life was created by the flow of the bulls’ semen. After the scorpion was crushed, its blood created all evil. In the sanctuary there is a prominent picture of Mithras and the bull. You can see the place followers of the cult used to sit on both sides of the cave. Here they had banquets with meat and blood from a bull, to celebrate Mithras’ victory. Afterwards, this space was used as catacombs, where Christians were buried. You can also visit the remains of a 1st century house. You can hear water run, but nobody knows where it comes from. It is probably an ancient roman waterway.</p>
