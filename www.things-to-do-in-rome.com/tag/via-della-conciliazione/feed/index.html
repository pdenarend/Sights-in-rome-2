				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The main road to the Vatican is called the Via della Conciliazione. It means Reconciliation Street. It was built between 1936 and 1950. Before, there was a block of houses here and lots of small streets. You had to make your way through these small alleyways and then suddenly you would arrive at Saint Peter’s square. When Gian Lorenzo Bernini designed the square, that was exactly the surprise effect he was looking for. Many years later this surprise arrival at the square was made undone by Benito Mussolini, the fascist Italian dictator. He decided Saint Peter’s needed a big access road, which became the Via della Conciliazione. The name refers to the reconciliation between the church and the Italian state. The country Italy was only created in 1870. Before, the Popes ruled the area around Rome, which was known as the Papal States. When the Italian republicans conquered the city and made it the new capital of a unified Italy, the Pope locked himself angrily away in Vatican City. No official borders between the two states were drawn until 1929, when Mussolini and the Pope came to an understanding of what the borders of the Vatican would be. The resulting treaty is called the Lateran treaty of 1929. In this treaty the exact boundaries of Vatican City were drawn. The Pope decided he wanted the Vatican to be as small as possible, to make sure the church would not be drawn into worldly affairs anymore.</p>
<p>To build this street, many old houses and churches were torn down. On both sides of the street you can see many obelisks. The Romans call these jokingly suppositories.</p>
