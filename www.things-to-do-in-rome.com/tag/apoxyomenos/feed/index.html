				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just before entering the Octagonal Courtyard you see this statue. This is the Apoxyomenos. It is a roman copy of a very famous lost statue by the Greek sculptor Lysippos. Often we only have roman marble copies of Greek statues left, because the bronze statues were often melted down to make cannonballs for example. This artist worked at the court of Alexander the Great. The fun thing about this statue is that it explains nicely how an athlete would clean himself after a wrestling match. In ancient time wrestlers would often put oil all over their body as a form of protection and to make them slippery. After the match the athlete would use an artifact to scrape of the oil and sweat from his body. This is a very good way to clean yourself as the oil extracts all the dirt and sweat from your pores. Romans used this method as well in the bath-houses to clean themselves. A friend or slave would rub you in with oil and then you would scrape it off. This way you get much cleaner than just taking a shower.</p>
