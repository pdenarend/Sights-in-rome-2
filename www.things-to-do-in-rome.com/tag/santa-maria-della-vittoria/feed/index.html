				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santa Maria della Vittoria is a very small church. Its fame derives from the statue which can be found inside. It is one of Bernini’s masterpieces, Teresa in Ecstasy. The church used to be a convent of the Carmelites. This order was reformed by Saint Teresa of Ávila. Teresa is one of three female doctors of the Church. She died in the night of the 4th to the 15th of October 1582. Incidentally, this was the night when a few days were skipped because of the introduction of the Gregorian calendar. She was canonized in 1622 and a few decades later Bernini designed the Cornaro chapel in this church to honor her.</p>

<p>Bernini designed the chapel like a theatre. You can even see spectators in the tribunes. These are Cardinal Federico Cornaro and his ancestors. Of course the main statue is the one of Teresa in ecstasy. It is made from one piece of marble. Teresa described this scene in one of her books like this.</p>
<p>‘I saw an angel close by me, on my left side, in bodily form. This I am not accustomed to see, unless very rarely. Though I have visions of angels frequently, yet I see them only by an intellectual vision, such as I have spoken of before. It was our Lord&#8217;s will that in this vision I should see the angel in this way. He was not large, but small of stature, and most beautiful — his face burning, as if he were one of the highest angels, who seem to be all of fire: they must be those whom we call cherubim. Their names they never tell me; but I see very well that there is in heaven so great a difference between one angel and another, and between these and the others, that I cannot explain it.</p>
<p>I saw in his hand a long spear of gold, and at the iron&#8217;s point there seemed to be a little fire. He appeared to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it. The soul is satisfied now with nothing less than God. The pain is not bodily, but spiritual; though the body has its share in it, even a large one. It is a caressing of love so sweet which now takes place between the soul and God, that I pray God of His goodness to make him experience it who may think that I am lying.’</p>
<p>Bernini followed closely the description of the Saint, even in the slight erotic overtones of the description of her ecstasy. Teresa seems to float in the air and her face is looking ecstatic indeed. Because of the slight erotic feeling of the statue, some people have argued to remove it from the Church or even destroy it. French author Charles de Brosses wrote in the 18th century: ‘If this is heavenly love, then I know it very well’. Bernini himself considered this his masterpiece.</p>
