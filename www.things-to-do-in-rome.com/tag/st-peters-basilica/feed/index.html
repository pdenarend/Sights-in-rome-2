				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the heart of Catholicism, Saint Peter’s Basilica. If you enter the church for the first time you might need some time to get accustomed to the sheer size of the church and its decorations. Don’t worry, it is normal. Just move away from the masses and let it sink in for a bit.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a bit about the history of this site. Do you know what this site was before St. Peter&#8217;s Basilica was built? It was Caligula’s Circus, which was later enlarged by Nero. Nero reigned from 54AD to 68AD and during his reign there was a great fire in 64AD. Nero had to blame somebody for the fire, because some people said he started it himself to make room for his new Golden Palace, the Domus Aurea. So Nero blamed the Christians, which was considered a new strange sect and told them that the Roman Gods were angry at them for worshiping only one God.</p>
<p><span id="more-614"></span></p>
<p>Nero was the first to persecute Christians. Saint Peter died during these persecutions. Peter had heard people wanted to arrest him so he left Rome, but just as he had left the city gates and was walking down Via Appia he came across Jesus who was walking the other way. Peter then famously said ‘Quo Vadis Domine’, where are you going my Lord. Jesus then replied that he was going back to Rome to be crucified again. Peter then knew that his time had come and he had to go back to Rome and die for his faith. He was arrested and then crucified in Nero’s Circus. Peter asked to be crucified upside down, because he thought he was not worthy to be crucified the same way as Jesus. Peter was then buried in a small necropolis next to the circus and over time this became a place for worship for the increasing number of Christians in the city.</p>
<p>Then Emperor Constantine decided to become Christian. He soon after ordered the building of Saint Peters Basilica. The building was built on the site of Saint Peters burial place. Construction was started in 324. The Basilica was consecrated in 326.</p>
<p>Of course the building you see today is not that building. Saint Peters was rebuilt in the 16th century in a renaissance and Baroque style. It was Pope Julius II who ordered that the old Basilica had to be torn down and a new one be built in 1506. He commissioned the famous renaissance architect Donato Bramante to design a new church. Of course both Julius II and Bramante died during the same decade and so the plan changed quite a few times (some of the architects that were involved were Raphael and Antonio da Sangallo) until in 1546 Michelangelo who was now 70 years old was assigned as the main architect for the Basilica. Michelangelo did not get paid for his work; he did it for the glory of the work and for his own salvation. He died at the age of 88 and work on the dome ceased for 24 years. It was finally finished in 22 months by Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana.</p>
<p>The original plan was for a church with a Greek cross floor plan, instead of a Latin cross, but in 1600 Pope Paul V commissioned Carlo Maderna to change the floor plan into a Latin cross. This way the church became much bigger than originally intended. Carlo Maderna is also responsible for the facade of the church and for the fountain on the right side of the piazza. Bernini added the other fountain to make it more symmetrical. Students of Bernini added the sculptures on top of the facade. You can see Christ in the middle and 10 apostles, replacing Judas with John the Baptist.</p>
<p>Paulus V added the text on the facade &#8216;In Honorem Principis Apost. &#8211; Paulus v Burghesius Romanus Pont. Max. Anno MDCXII &#8211; Pont. VII&#8217; which means In honor of the prince of apostles, Pontifex Maximus Paul V of the Borghese family made this in the year 1612. The letters are 2 meters high.</p>
<p>It took 120 years to build the Church; Most of the material is marble, granite and travertine. Some of it came from Colosseum and Forum, where it was taken from ancient buildings.</p>
