				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This room in the Vatican Museums is the Round Room. This room was also designed by Michelangelo Simonetti designed. Does it remind you of something? Well it should. It is clearly based on the pantheon. If you have not seen the pantheon yet, please go. It is amazing. The mosaic floors dates back to the second century BC and depicts the battle of the Centaurs. They came from bathhouses in Ostia, the old port of Rome. Also these mosaics were brought here piece by piece.</p>
<p>In the center is a monolithic basin, so it is made out of one piece of porphyry. It is from the time of Emperor Nero. Maybe you remember him. He is one of the most infamous Emperors. According to legend he was responsible for the famous fire in Rome in 64 AD. Nero fiddled while Rome burnt. He used the space the fire created to build his enormous golden house. This tub belonged in that house. He famously said when he moved in; ‘Finally I can live like a human being’. This is made of red porphyry. This material was known as the Emperor’s marble, because purple was the color of the Emperors and the material at that time could only be found in a remote place in Egypt. It still is extremely expensive material.</p>
<p>Nero of course committed suicide after losing a civil war. His famous last words were: ‘Qualis artifex pereo’: What an artist dies in me. His house was afterwards torn down and the Colosseum was built on top of parts of it.</p>

<p>The statue on the right next to the door is a statue of Antinous. In this room is also a bust of the same boy, see if you can discover him, the face is exactly the same. Antinous was the lover of an Emperor. This was Emperor Hadrian, famous for building a wall to keep out the Scots in England and for building the Pantheon. Hadrian met him in Greece when Antinous was just a boy and the Emperor was 54. Antinous accompanied Hadrian on his many travels until the boy drowned in Egypt in the Nile. Hadrian was struck with grief and declared the boy a god. He then ordered statues to be made to be worshipped throughout the empire. This is way the face of Antinous is one of the best known faces from antiquity. You can see a bust a Hadrian next to the bronze statue of Hercules. You can always recognize Hadrian because he had a beard. He was the first Emperor to have a beard, which he wore according to Greek fashion.</p>

<p>The other very famous statue in this room is the bronze Hercules. It was found in 1864 close to Campo de’ Fiori. It is one of the very few original bronze statues left from ancient times. Many were melted down. This one survived and we know why. It was buried because it was struck by lightning. Lightning was the symbol of Jupiter, the most important god. The romans were very superstitious people so when this statue was struck they thought Jupiter does not like this statue. So they buried it deep in the ground. So thanks to Jupiter we still have this amazing bronze statue.</p>
<p>There is also a big statue of a man sitting. This was Emperor Galba. He is not a very famous Emperor, because he was only Emperor for seven months. In the civil war following Nero’s death Galba promised the Praetorian Guard (the Emperor personal army) riches if they supported him to become Emperor. Once Galba was Emperor he refused to pay up and the Praetorian Guard then murdered him.</p>
<p>The next statue is of Emperor Claudius. Claudius was one of the few family members of notorious Caligula he did not kill, because he thought his uncle was retarded. Claudius lisped and often had drool coming from his mouth and probably epileptic attacks and that is why his whole family thought he was harmless. When Caligula was murdered the Praetorian Guard proclaimed Claudius Emperor, because he promised them money and he was the only one of the imperial family still alive. Claudius turned out to be a decent Emperor and was not retarded at all. It was under Claudius Britain was conquered. You can clearly see that the Emperors were displayed as gods. It is very unlikely Claudius had a body like that of his statue.</p>
