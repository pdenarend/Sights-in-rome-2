				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you walked down Via della Conciliazione towards Saint Peter’s, you enter a different country once you cross the street and stand on Saint Peter’s square. So first of, let’s talk a bit about how this country came to be. When the Western Roman Empire fell in 476 AD Italy entered difficult times. Many different barbarians invaded the peninsula, like the Goths, the Vandals and the Huns. There was no more Emperor in Rome. So the Bishop of Rome, the Pope, became the ruler of the city and in the next few centuries the power of the papacy grew very fast. Many rich people left their land to the papacy after they died, to secure a place in heaven, and slowly the Pope became the ruler of most of the land around Rome. This was the beginning of the Papal States. The Papal States were comprised of what are now the Umbria and Lazio regions. These lands remained in the possession of the Pope until 1870 when Italy was unified. Rome was declared the capital of the new Italian kingdom. The Pope at that time, Pius IX, was really unhappy about losing all his land and so he locked himself up inside the Vatican City and never left again.</p>

<p>The legal status of the Vatican was made clear many years later in 1929 in the Lateran Treaty. The Pope and Mussolini drew the borders of the Vatican. It became a separate country inside Italy, with its own laws and regulations. The Pope wanted to keep the Vatican state as small as possible, because he felt that earlier Popes had been distracted from their religious functions, because they were also temporal rulers. So the Vatican state is now comprised of everything inside the leonine walls, the walls around Vatican City, but also a few very important churches in the city like Saint John of Lateran and Santa Maria Maggiore. Also the Papal Palace in Castelgandolfo, close to Rome, is Vatican territory.</p>
<p>So now the Vatican is a very small country. It has its own postal service. If you want to send postcards from Italy it is a lot smarter to use the Vatican post, because it is a lot more efficient.  There is a post office on the square. The Vatican also has its own license plates which start with SCV. This stands for Stato dello Città del Vaticano, or the Vatican city state, but Romans often remark when they see an expensive car with a license plate like that: ‘Se Cristo Vedesse’ which means ‘If Christ would see..’</p>
