				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Spanish Steps are by far the most famous steps in Rome and maybe the world. The steps were built in 1726. It is strange that the steps are called Spanish steps, because they were financed by a French ambassador. He wanted to provide a nice walkway to the French Church on top of the hill, the Trinità dei Monti. Before, there were only a few small paths up. In the end they became known as the Spanish steps, because the Piazza below is called Piazza di Spagna. This is because the Spanish Embassy to the Holy See is located on the Piazza. You can see the Spanish flag hanging from a big palazzo close to the column.</p>
<p>The steps consist of ten times twelve steps and have three terraces, which is a reference to the trinity, after which the church on top is named. At the top there is a very nice view of Piazza di Spagna and also the rest of Rome. The dome of Saint Peter’s can be seen. Every spring, many flowers are put on the steps, which make them look even more amazing.</p>
<p>Once, there was a model market on the steps. Painters and sculptors would come here to pick their models. During the touristic high season the steps will be filled with people. Piazza di Spagna can get extremely busy. I always recommend people to do a very very late night tour to see these kinds of monuments without the masses of people. If you pass here at 2 AM on a warm summer night, you will have a really different experience than at 4PM when you can’t see the steps because of the masses of people. The same goes for Trevi Fountain. Go at 2AM, really, you’ll thank me for it (especially if you have gone during the day in the high season).</p>
