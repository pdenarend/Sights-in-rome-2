				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The main station in Rome is called Termini. This has nothing to do with the English word terminal. It is Latin for ‘at the bathhouses’, the Terme. Diocletian’s bathhouses were (and still are) very close to here. On this spot a small station was built in 1873, but it was too small, so Mussolini decided a new, imposing station should be built in 1937. The building as we see it now was opened only in 1950. The building’s purpose was to show off the greatness of Fascist Italy. If you look at the sides of the building you can see the design was partly taken from the Colosseum. This is typical fascist style. It is very simple, going back to classical shapes without too many ornaments.</p>

<p>The piazza in front of Termini is called Piazza dei 500. It is named after the 500 soldiers that died in 1887, fighting in Ethiopia. On the northern side of the piazza you can still see a piece of the old city walls standing. This wall was built in the 4th century BC after the Gauls invaded.</p>
<p>The wall of Servius Tullius has almost completely disappeared, but a small part can be seen on piazza cinquecento next to the Termini train station. Traditionally sinners were buried here, because people believed this was the spot Nero was buried after he killed himself. Prostitutes were for example buried here.</p>
