				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Trevi Fountain is the most famous fountain of Rome. It was made famous by Italian filmmaker Federico Fellini’s film ‘La Dolce Vita’, in which Anita Ekberg takes a bath in the fountain with Marcello Mastroianni watching. I would advise against jumping in now, as it is continuously watched by policemen who prevent people from reenacting the scene. The best time to visit the fountain is two o’clock in the morning. Then, the tourists are all gone and spotlights illuminate the fountain beautifully. The police are still there though.</p>
<p>The fountain was built halfway through the 18th century. It was paid for with a tax on wine. The story goes that the Pope who instituted this tax couldn’t leave his house without eggs and tomatoes being thrown at him. In the end his investment paid off though. Just look at the number of tourists looking at the fountain (unless you are here at four in the morning). The fountain is located against Palazzo Poli. It was designed by Bernini, but the plan was only executed fifty years after his death by Nicola Salvi. Bernini never saw the fountain. The water comes from the Aqua Virgo, which runs under Via Condotti and ends up here.</p>
<p>The central figure is the god of sea Oceanus. On both sides of Oceanus you can see two Tritons who are taming two horses. One is wild and the other one is quiet. This is a reference to the two shapes the sea can take. The water from the fountain flows from here to many other fountains in the city, like the ones on Piazza Navona.</p>
<p>Maybe you have seen people throwing coins in the fountain. According to legend, if you throw a coin with your right hand over your left shoulder (not the other way around), you will return to Rome. If you throw two coins you will also fall in love with an Italian, but watch out, if you throw three, you will marry one. Every year, about 90.000 euro worth of coins is thrown into the fountain. This money is used to keep the fountain in good shape.</p>
<p>The church in front of the fountain is called the Santi Vicenzi ed Anastasio. In this church the hearts of almost all 17th, 18th and 19th century Popes are being kept. This macabre tradition was discontinued by Pope Pius X in the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
