				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Santa Maria del Popolo is an Augustinian church on Piazza del Popolo. It is very small, but contains work by world-famous artists, like Bernini and Caravaggio. The facade was redone in Baroque style by Bernini in 1660.</p>
<p>Piazza del Popolo was the first thing people would see of Rome as they entered the City. The northern gate was here and most visitors and pilgrims to the city entered here. The gate still stands, but the city now expands much further north.</p>

<h2>The Apse and Dome of Santa Maria del Popolo</h2>
<figure id="attachment_319" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image238.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-319" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image238.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="The Apse and Dome of Santa Maria del Popolo" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Apse and Dome of Santa Maria del Popolo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Inside, the dome was decorated with a mosaic by Raphael which represents the creation of the world. The apse was designed by renaissance architect Bramante with a stained glass window by Guillaume de Marcillat.</p>
<p>Pinturicchio, favorite painter of the Borgia Pope Alexander VI, painted the vault, including a coronation of the Virgin.</p>
<h2>Cerasi Chapel</h2>
<figure id="attachment_321" style="width: 500px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image240.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-321" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image240.jpg?resize=500%2C661" alt="Conversion of Saint Paul" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Conversion of Saint Paul</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_322" style="width: 599px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image241.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-322" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image241.jpg?resize=599%2C776" alt="Crucifixion of Saint Peter" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Crucifixion of Saint Peter</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the left side of the apse you can find the Cerasi Chapel, which holds two paintings by Caravaggio. One is the Crucifixion of Saint Peter. Peter is, on his own request, crucified upside down. He did not think he was worthy enough to be crucified the same way as Christ. The other painting shows the Conversion of Saint Paul on the road to Damascus. Paul, who used to persecute Christians, falls from his horse on the road to Damascus as he sees the light and is converted to Christianity. Between the two paintings by Caravaggio is an altarpiece by Annibale Carracci, an important painter in the baroque style. See how different the work of Caravaggio is from the work of Carracci? Caravaggio is a master of playing with light and dark. Look also at the face of Saint Peter and see how much life there is his face. These are two masterpieces.</p>
<h2>Chigi Chapel</h2>
<figure id="attachment_323" style="width: 603px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image242.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-323" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image242.jpg?resize=603%2C413" alt="Chigi Chapel" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Chigi Chapel</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the left side of the church you can find the Chigi chapel, which was started by Raphael and finished by Bernini. Bernini also added the statue of Habakkuk and the Angel and Daniel and the lion.</p>
