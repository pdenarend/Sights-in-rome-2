				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The total territory of the Vatican is 110 acres, which is 44 hectares. Within the walls only 900 people live, 700 men and 200 women. The Vatican is of course a country. The Pope is the head of state. The Vatican City State is the only absolute monarchy left in Europe. The Vatican issues its own passport and license plates, but very few people have Vatican nationality. Often people obtain Vatican nationality for the duration of their assignment. The Vatican has their own euros but they are almost impossible to obtain. You can buy them for a lot of money in collectorsâ€™ stores. They also have TV network and radio station. Of course there are also government offices and courthouses, grocery stores and pharmacies. The Vatican has a fire department and its own military corps. This is the Swiss Guards. There are about 100 guards now, but before it was a real army. The corps was founded by Pope Julius II, who just wanted Swiss mercenaries, because at that time the Swiss were the best and most organized fighters of Europe.</p>
<p>To be a Swiss Guard you have to be between 19 and 25. You have to be Swiss. They often come from the Italian speaking part of Switzerland. You cannot have a police record, not even a parking ticket. You have to come from a good catholic home and you are not allowed to marry while you serve the Pope. They are trained in about 600 different weapons so they can pick up anything on the floor and kill you with it.</p>
<p>They live within the walls and do not pay rent or food. It is considered an honorary job. Afterwards it is very easy for them to find a job in Switzerland, because it is still highly regarded.</p>
