				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the middle of the Forum Romanum you can see the Temple of Castor and Pollux. Only three Corinthian columns are still standing. It was built in 484 BC. Castor and Pollux were twins. Their father was Jupiter, who had seduced their mother Leda by taking the shape of a swan. Castor and Pollux were then born out of eggs. They were very important for the Romans. They believed the twins had helped them during an important battle against the Latin people at the lake of Regilius in 486 BC. After the battle 2 strong unknown warriors were seen on this spot, giving water to their horses. Afterwards these warriors disappeared but the Romans believed they had been Castor and Pollux. Then a temple was built on this spot.</p>

<p>The twins were not true gods, because their mother had been mortal. So when it turned out one died and the other one was immortal they were very sad. One was living in the underworld and the other one on earth. They wanted to stay together so their father put them as stars in heaven as the sign Gemini, twins.</p>
