				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This park is called the Villa Borghese. It was the first of its kind in Rome. In 1901 it became property of the state. In the park you can find museums, foreign academies, a zoo, an artificial lake and an amphitheatre. It is a pleasant park where a lot of Romans come on Sundays to stroll around with their children.</p>
<p>The most important museum you can find here is the Galleria Borghese, which houses the famous baroque statues of Bernini. It is something really worth visiting, but you have to make a reservation in advance, because the museum is small and a lot of people want to go there. There is no point going there without tickets.</p>
