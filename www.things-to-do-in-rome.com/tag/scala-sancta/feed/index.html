				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next to Saint John in Lateran, on the other side of the street, you can find the Scala Sancta. This building houses the holy steps. The building was built by Domenico Fontana in 1589. According to legend Christ climbed the steps in this building on the Friday of his death, going to Pontius Pilatus’ house. The mother of Emperor Constantine, Saint Helen, would have taken the steps from Pilatus’ house in Jerusalem in 326 AD. This story only starts being told in the 7<sup>th</sup> century though. Only faithful are allowed to ascend the steps, and only on their knees. The steps are protected by wood and on some places you can see some blood, allegedly from Christ.</p>

<p>At the top of the steps is the Sancta sanctorum, the holiest of holy, which is never accessible. It contains very precious relics, like a portrait of Jesus painted by angels, some mothers milk from the virgin Mary, a piece of Christ’s shoe and some leftovers from the last supper. Once Christ’s foreskin was kept here, but it was stolen during the sack of Rome in 1527.</p>
