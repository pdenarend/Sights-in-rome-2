				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Galleria della Candelabra is named after the candle holders in the niches. This used to be open loggia. There was no roof here, but Michelangelo Simonetti closed it in the 18th century. Notice how the floor goes downhill and have a look at the beautiful marble floors. The ceilings were painted very late for the Vatican. They are from 1883 and were painted by Domenico Torti and Ludwig Seitz under Pope Leo XIII.</p>
<p>In this room many Popes would stay during the summer, because it is one of the few places in the Vatican where you can enjoy a nice breeze. The Vatican is very hot in the summer. That is why nowadays the Pope stays outside Rome in the summer in Castel Gandolfo.</p>

<p>This room is filled with statues but most of them are not very famous or important. They were all found buried around Rome and many have an alcoholic theme. You will see many people drinking or drunk and have something to do with the cult of Bacchus (Latin) or Dionysus (Greek), the god of wine, madness and ecstasy.</p>
<p>On your right you will see a goddess with what looks like a lot of breasts. She is Diana, or Artemis in Greek. She is the goddess of hunting and fertility. For a long time people thought she had a lot of breasts but often she is also depicted as a normal human looking god. Look to the statue facing Diana on the other side of the hall. This also is Diana but represented in a more normal fashion. We know Diana had an important cult in Ephese in Greece. The problem is the cult was secret so nothing about it ever was written down. We know it was very important but we know little about it. Nowadays some archaeologists think that they are not breasts but represent the testicles of bulls which were a symbol of male fertility.</p>
<p>The next statue is Bacchus, the God of Wine. He is carrying a little boy on his back. It is very famous because it still has the original glass eyes. Before, many statues had glass eyes. Unfortunately many of these eyes were broken when barbarians invaded. They thought the eyes were made out of precious stones, but they were just made out of glass.</p>
<p>Maybe you notice that a lot of statues are dressed in a fig leaf. This is absolutely not classical. The Romans never had any problems with nudity, or sexuality for that matter. Most private parts of the statues were taken off in the 17th and 18th century and replaced with fig leaves, because the Popes thought the statues to be to indecent to show naked.</p>
