				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This room in the Vatican is called the king Sobieski Room and is named after the huge painting by the Polish artist Jan Matejko. It shows the victory of the king of Poland John III Sobieski, who stopped the Ottoman Turks from invading Vienna in 1683. Thanks to Sobieski Europe was not overrun by the Turks. The painting was donated to the Pope by the Artist in the 1800’s. All the other paintings in here also date back to 1800’s.</p>
<p>Next to the door is a painting of the Martyrs of Gorkum. These 19 catholic Dutch Franciscans were hanged by the Protestants on 9 July 1572 in the Dutch religious wars. They were canonized on 29 June 1865 by the Pope in Rome. The painting is by Cesare Fracassini.</p>
<p>If you look out of the window you can see a building on the other side. This is the Sistine Chapel from the outside. As you can see it was built as a fort. Look at the top of the building where you can see places where archers could shoot from.</p>
