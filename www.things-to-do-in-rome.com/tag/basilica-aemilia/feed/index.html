				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As you walk down you can see the foundation of the Basilica Aemilia on your right side. It was built in 197 BC. This building was meant to protect people from the rain or the sun. The activities that took place outside on the forum had to be continued on rainy days. it was some sort of trade center. Also, magistrates would hold trials here. That is also where the name comes from. Basilica comes from the Greek word Basileus, which means king. Of course, in ancient times it was the king who would administer justice. It was paid for by the Aemilia family, which was one of the most powerful families at that time.</p>

<p>It was destroyed in 410 by Alaric, the famous king of the Goths who sacked Rome. You probably know the word Basilica as a name for a church. This is because the first Christians used this type of construction for their first churches. The form of the classical temple was not suited to hold mass.</p>
