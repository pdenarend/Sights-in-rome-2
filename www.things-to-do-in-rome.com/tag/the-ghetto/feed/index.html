				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The area between Capitoline Hill and the river used to be the Jewish Ghetto. From the 2nd century onward Jewish people lived in Rome. They used to live across the river in Trastevere. There were 13 synagogues in ancient Rome and they were allowed to exercise their faith freely. This situation changed radically in the middle ages. Jewish men had to wear a yellow hat and women a yellow ribbon. Many more Jews came to Rome after their expulsion from the Kingdom of Spain in 1492. Then, on the 26th of July by order of Pope Paul IV the Jews were locked up in a Ghetto. They were not allowed to leave at night and the ghetto could be closed off by big gates. They were just allowed to trade in second hand clothing, wool, furs and iron scraps. The Jews were only freed from the Ghetto in 1798 when the troops of Napoleon conquered Rome and abducted the Pope to Paris. The walls were only torn down in 1870.</p>
<p>Some inhabitants of the Ghetto were deported in the Second World War. On 16 October 1943, the SS went around the area around the Porticus of Octavia and captured about 1000 Jewish people. They were deported to Auschwitz. Only 17 managed to survive. There is a sign about this on the piazza in front of the Porticus of Octavia, which is called Largo 16 ottobre 1943.</p>
<figure id="attachment_135" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image061.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-135" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image061.jpg?resize=300%2C214" alt="Porticus of Octavia" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Porticus of Octavia</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the main street of the Ghetto stands this Roman doorway. It is called the Porticus of Octavia. It was a big square, surrounded by 300 columns. There also was a library here. Now, just the entrance gate is left. This also was built by Emperor August, in honor of his sister Octavia, the mother of Marcellus. Of Emperor Augustus it was said that he found Rome in brick and left her in marble. Augustus ruled for a very long time. It was a prosperous and peaceful time for the empire. His reign is sometimes called the Pax Augusta, the peace of Augustus.</p>
<figure id="attachment_136" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image062.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-136" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image062.jpg?resize=300%2C167" alt="Theatre of Marcellus" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Theatre of Marcellus</figcaption></figure>
<p>This very odd looking building once was the Theatre of Marcellus. You can clearly see that in Roman times it was a Theatre, but then in the middle ages a powerful aristocratic family, the Orsini, made it into a fort and palace.</p>
<p>Emperor Augustus built the theatre for his nephew Marcellus, who was supposed to succeed him. Unfortunately, Marcellus died at a very young age.</p>
<p>20.000 people could be seated here. It is older than the Colosseum. At the opening of the theatre, some parts of the seating collapsed and people wanted to leave, but Augustus himself sat down at the most dangerous spot to keep people from leaving. This was a real theatre and not an arena, so no gladiator fights where held here, but still, in some plays one actor would really die. Convicted criminals were used for this. Next to the theatre are some remains of a very old temple of Apollo.</p>
<figure id="attachment_137" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image063.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-137" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image063.jpg?resize=300%2C218" alt="The Synagogue" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Synagogue</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Synagogue was built in 1904. The building of the synagogue was meant to show the Jews that the new Italian state would do a better job in looking out for them than the Papacy ever did. The synagogue has a big dome, a challenge to Saint Peterâ€™s. The Pope became very angry and laid a ban on the new Italian state.</p>
<p>Now about 15.000 Jews live in Rome. Most of them live outside the ghetto these days.</p>
<p>Pope John Paul II was the first Pope to visit the synagogue in 1986. It was also visited later by Pope Benedict XVI.</p>
