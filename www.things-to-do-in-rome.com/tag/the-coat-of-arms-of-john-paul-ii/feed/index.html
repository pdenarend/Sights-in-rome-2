				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you look to the floor at the left nave of Saint Peter&#8217;s, you can see the coat of arms of John Paul II. He designed this himself. Before, Popes were of noble decent and so had a coat-of-arms. The modern Popes are no longer from the nobility so they design their own coat-of-arms. John Paul used the colors of the Vatican flag, the M for Mary, because he dedicated his papacy to the Virgin Mary, who always had inspired him. Then you can see the words Totus Tuus means totally yours. PM stands for Pontifex Maximus, an old Roman title for the highest priest which the Popes took over.</p>
<p>Close to it you can seeÂ the monument to James III. He was the last of the Stuarts, the family that ruled England for many years. This monument is made by Antonio Canova, the same artist that did Perseus with the head of Medusa in the Vatican museums. This family was expelled from England, because they did not want to give up their Catholic faith. They took refuge in Rome 1689. His wife also got a monument in front of him. This is a neo-classical artwork, which makes it stand out in the church, because most of the interior is Baroque.</p>
