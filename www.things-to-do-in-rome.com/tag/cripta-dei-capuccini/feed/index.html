				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this church, one of the most macabre sights of Rome can be seen. The church is called Santa Maria della Concezione, but the adjacent crypt is better known. It is the Cripta dei Cappuccini. The church was commissioned by Antonio Barberini, twin brother of Pope Urban VIII. The most famous artwork in the church is the painting of Archangel Michael defeating the devil, by Guido Reni. The angel was so beautiful that people thought Guido had gone to heaven to paint the angel, also because the painter had not been seen for quite some time. Guido said: ‘The beauty of the angel you cannot find on earth. I have not seen him and he springs from my fantasy only, but the devil I have seen many times, so I know how he looks.</p>
<p>There is also a copy of a painting by Caravaggio, representing Saint Francis. The original hangs in the room of the prior and cannot be visited.</p>
<p>Next to the church is the macabre crypt. The capuchin monks were moved to this convent by Urban VIII. They agreed, but asked the Pope if they could take their deceased brothers with them. The Pope then gave them earth from Jerusalem for their crypt. The bones of their brothers were then dug up by the light of torches and were taken to this church. The bones were then used to decorate the crypt. The second crypt is filled with bones from soldiers who volunteered to protect the Pope when Italian troops were trying to conquer Rome in the Risorgimento. They died in 1870 and were buried here by the capuchin monks. On the right side you can see the skeleton of Prince Matteo Orsini, who according to his wishes was buried standing up, wearing his habit. In the 5th and last crypt, visitors are reminded that ‘What you are, we were, and what we are, you shall become’.</p>
