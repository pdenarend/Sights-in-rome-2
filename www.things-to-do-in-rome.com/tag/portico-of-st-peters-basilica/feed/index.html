				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you enter under the balcony you will first end up in a hall. Here, on the far left and right sides you can see two statues. On the left side you can see a statue of Charlemagne, who was crowned by the Pope in the church in the year 800. On the right side is a more beautiful statue, made by Bernini. It is Constantine, the first Christian Emperor and the founder of the first Saint Peter’s Basilica. Here we see the vision of Constantine. He is sitting on his horse and looking up. In the sky he sees the sign of the cross. The next day we would make his soldiers paint this sign on their shields and they would go on to win the battle of the Milvian Bridge which would make Constantine Emperor. After this he started to sponsor Christianity. The main doors in the middle come from the old basilica. Inside there are 44 altars, 11 domes, 778 columns, 135 mosaic paintings and 395 statues. The church is 192 meters long. It is the largest church in the world and they have markings to prove it. In the middle of the church the names and lengths of other churches can be seen. This is why the middle section is blocked, so that people stop walking over the markings.</p>
<p><span id="more-616"></span></p>
<p>The doors on the right are the Holy Doors. They are opened only every 25 years in a Jubilee year, a Holy year. This If you look at them from the inside you will see the entrance is closed with bricks. This tradition was started by Alexander VI, the Borgia Pope. The last time they were opened was in the year 2000 by Pope John Paul II. They are made of bronze. The opening of the doors always takes place on Christmas eve. The Pope knocks on the doors with a silver hammer and they open up. He is he first to go through and followed by rest of clergy and pilgrims. This happens in all the mayor Basilica’s of Rome. Santa Maria Maggiore, Saint John Lateran and Saint Paul outside the walls all have holy doors. They symbolize the entrance to heaven and if you pass through your sins are supposedly forgiven. After the Holy year the doors are closed with bricks again.</p>
<p>Enter the main door go straight to the left where you will see a red circle on the floor. The circle we are standing on is made of porphyry, the same expensive stone from which Nero’s bathtub in the Vatican museums is made. On this spot, but a few meters below, Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by the Pope on Christmas eve in the year 800. Mother Teresa, Queen Elizabeth, Lady Diana and even George Clooney have all stood here.</p>
