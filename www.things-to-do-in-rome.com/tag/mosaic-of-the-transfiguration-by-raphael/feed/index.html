				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Saint Peter&#8217;s Basilica, you can see a copy of a painting that now hangs inside the Vatican Museum. This is a mosaic; if you look closely you can see it is made out of a lot of tiny stones. It&#8217;s a Mosaic of the Transfiguration by Raphael. This was his last work; he was very ill when he painted it and knew he was dying. He asked his friends to carry this painting to the Pantheon on the day of his funeral, because he loved this painting so much. It is indeed one of his masterpieces. If you have the time, go and see it as well in the Vatican Museums, because the real thing is much more impressive.</p>
<p>It of course represents the Transfiguration. This is when Christ showed his true godly nature to Saint John, Saint Peter and Saint James. He starts flying and Elijah and Moses appear next to him in the sky. The apostles fall down, blinded by the light.</p>
<p><span id="more-653"></span></p>
<p>Below all those people are in a state of confusion. Some apostles are trying to cure a possessed boy, which they cannot do. Only the transfigured Christ, later, will save the boy.</p>
<p>Raphael’s love of his life was a baker’s daughter. He was never allowed to marry her, because she was too poor. In Italian she is called La Fornarina. She appears in many of his paintings. Here we see her in pink and blue on the foreground. When Raphael died she entered a monastery.</p>
