				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the room of Heliodorus, painted from 1512-1514. This was the second room to be painted and would have been the private chamber of the apartments. Just a few paintings here were painted by Raphael himself.</p>
<p>The first fresco which you can see in the picture above is the Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple. This fresco was completed by Raphael himself. It represents the biblical story of Heliodorus who was sent by the King of Syria to steal the treasure of the Temple of Jerusalem. You see him laying on the ground on the right. The high priest on the left prayed to god who sent a horseman to drive Heliodorus out. The High priest is a portrait of Pope Julius II. Raphael has also added a portrait of himself next to the people carrying away the Pope.</p>

<figure id="attachment_259" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image181.jpg"><img class="wp-image-259 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image181.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="Attila" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Attila</figcaption></figure>
<p>The next fresco is the meeting of Leo I with Attila, which was completed by students.  Attila the Hun is convinced by Pope Leo the Great not to attack Rome in 452. This really happened. We don’t know exactly how Leo did it, but the fact is Attila retreated after meeting the Pope outside the city gates.</p>
<p>Here we see Leo is assisted by Saint Peter and Saint Paul, who frighten Attila in retreating. If you look at the face of the cardinal in the forefront behind the Pope and then look at the face of the Pope; you can see that it is the same face. Julius II died and Raphael made his students paint the face of the new Pope and it was the cardinal painted behind the Pope that became the new Pope.</p>
<figure id="attachment_260" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image182.jpg"><img class="wp-image-260 size-full" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image182.jpg?resize=600%2C451" alt="The Mass at Bolsena" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Mass at Bolsena</figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there is the Mass at Bolsena is by Raphael. Here we see a priest who had doubts about the presence of Christ in the Eucharist, or the bread you get at mass. During a mass he saw blood pour out of the sacred host and his doubts disappeared. You can see Pope Julius II, always recognizable by his long white beard, kneeling in front of the priest. You can also see the Swiss guards down below.</p>
<figure id="attachment_261" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image183.jpg"><img class="wp-image-261 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image183.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="The Liberation of Peter" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Liberation of Peter</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of Raphael&#8217;s masterpieces is the liberation of St Peter by Raphael above the window.  Here we see the story of how an angel appeared to St Peter who was locked up in prison. The angel asked him to stand up and when he did his chains fell off and the angel led him out into the street, while the guards were sleeping.</p>
<p>You can see the guards waking up in bewilderment to find out that the prisoner is missing. If you look at the face of Saint Peter you can see that it is the face of Julius II. This fresco is considered a masterpiece because of the light that emanates from it and the nice contrast which is created by the darkness of the prison bars. The bars were not painted al secco, or added on later. They were incorporated into the fresco at same time. This is very difficult to do.</p>
