				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This statue is one of the most famous in the world. It is la Pietà by Michelangelo. Pietà means pity or sorrow. Michelangelo was only 23 years old and it took him one year to sculpt. It is the only artwork by the artist that is signed. If you look at the ribbon across Maria’s chest you can see his name. It says Michelangelo Buanorotte Florentino ha fatto questo, Michelangelo Buonarotti from Florence has made this. He signed this work, because one day he was looking at his statue and some people came in and said the statue was made by a different sculptor. Michelangelo got angry and chiseled his name in at night.</p>
<p>Michelangelo has been criticized for this work as well. Critics say that if Maria would stand up, she would be twice as big as Christ. Also, some considered Maria to be way too youthful. She looks younger than her son. The reason Maria looks big, is because nowadays the statue stands in the wrong position. Michelangelo created it thinking it would stand on ground level. So you would look at the statue from above. If you look at the statue like that, suddenly the perspective works. The same applies to the David in Florence. People criticize this statue because its hands, feet and head are too big for its body. This is because the statue was meant to stand on the Cathedral, far up. People would only be able to see it from far, so he made the hands and feet bigger so you can notice them.</p>

<p>In 1972 a crazy person came in the church and screamed “I am Jesus and this is not my mother”. He destroyed some parts of the statue with a hammer and broke her nose. Some tourists took pieces with them as a souvenir. The man was arrested and put in the Vatican jail cell, the last person to have been in a Vatican jail. Ever since security is very strict. The statue is now behind bulletproof glass, which is a shame, because you cannot see it from up close.</p>
