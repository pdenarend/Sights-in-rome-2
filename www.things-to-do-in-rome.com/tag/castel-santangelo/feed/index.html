				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Castel Sant’Angelo is a very strange building. Once it was the mausoleum for Emperor Hadrian. It was built in 135 AD. Later, Emperors Marcus Aurelius, Septimus Severus and Caracalla were also buried here.</p>
<p>In the middle ages it was transformed into a fortress, to protect the Vatican. It is called the fortress of angels because Pope Gregory the Great saw an angel appear above the building in 590. At that time Rome was suffering from an epidemic of plague. The Pope held 40 processions to stop the plague and at the end he saw Archangel Michael appear above the castle, who put his sword back in its holder. Everybody understood this meant the plague was over and the next day it was. Ever since the building is called Castel Sant’Angelo and a statue of Archangel Michael putting his sword in his holder stands on top of the building. The current statue dates from the 18th century.</p>
<p>The fortress is 5 stories high. Originally it must have looked quite different. Trees grew around a big statue of Hadrian in his chariot. Because the mausoleum was built on a very strategic spot, close to the only bridge to the Vatican, it was transformed in a fortress. It has been a papal residence and prison and five Popes were executed inside. Now it is a museum. From the top of the building you have a very beautiful view of Rome.</p>
