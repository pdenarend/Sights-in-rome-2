				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santi Quattro Coronati is a very interesting but relatively unknown church. It used to be a fortress and monastery, which protected the Lateran palace, where the Popes used to live before they moved to southern France and then to the Vatican. It was built in the 4th century and rebuilt in the 11th century after the Normans attacked. Now, Augustinian nuns live here. The floor is especially notable, because at least 200 antique marble stones were used to make the pattern.</p>
<p><span id="more-530"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_187" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image112.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-187" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image112.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Inside the Quattro Coronati" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Inside the Quattro Coronati</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the fresco on the apse the two stories of the Quattro Coronati are represented. Quattro Coronati means the four crowned ones. This refers to either 4 sculptors who refused to sculpt a statue of the pagan god Asclepius, who were then thrown in led coffins into the sea. The other four crowned ones were four soldiers who refused to carry out this sentence and who were tortured using sharp, red hot crowns. In the 17th century, when the fresco was painted, people had forgotten to which four crowned martyrs the church was dedicated so both groups were painted.</p>
<figure id="attachment_188" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image113.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-188" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image113.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="The Chapel of Sylvester" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Chapel of Sylvester</figcaption></figure>
<p>The highlight of the church is the chapel of Pope Sylvester with frescos from the 13th century. You get to this chapel by going outside the church to the courtyard, then enter the monastery and ring a bell next to the fence. A nun will then appear and you will give her a few euros. She will then buzz you in and you can go and see the chapel. Please do not skip this, if only for the experience.</p>
<p>The chapel is very small and is filled with frescoes from the 13th century. They show the legend of Pope Sylvester, a Pope who was appointed by Emperor Constantine. According to legend he converted Constantine to Christianity. He lived on a mountain as a hermit close to Rome. Constantine was suffering from the plague at the time as a punishment for having persecuted Christians. Roman senators advised him to bath in the blood of 3000 children. He couldn’t bring himself to kill so many children and in a dream he is visited by Saint Peter and Paul who tell him to go and visit Sylvester and enjoy a much healthier bath: baptism.  When he visited Sylvester he showed him pictures of the men (Saint Peter and Paul) that visited him in his dream and Constantine was impressed. He was then healed from the plague and became the first Christian Emperor. The next seven days he issued a lot of laws promoting Christianity and on the eighth day he personally laid the foundation of Saint Peter’s Basilica.</p>
<p>In the fresco above the entrance you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>The senators of Rome with Constantine in front of the mothers with the children in whose blood he was supposed to bath</li>
<li>Constantine in bed who dreams about Peter and Paul</li>
<li>Constantine on the road to the mountain where Sylvester lives</li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_189" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image114.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-189" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image114.jpg?resize=300%2C213" alt="Peter &amp; Paul visit Constantine" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Peter &amp; Paul visit Constantine</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the left wall you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constantine meeting Sylvester</li>
<li>Sylvester shows Constantine a picture of Peter and Paul</li>
<li>Constantine being baptized</li>
<li>Constantine makes Sylvester Pope and kneels in front of him and offers him the Lateran Palace</li>
<li>Sylvester arrives in Rome at the Lateran palace.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the right wall you can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>The miracle of the bull. Jewish scribes argue with Sylvester while Constantine and his mother Helena attend. The Jewish scribes show the power of their religion by whispering something in the ear of a bull, who immediately dies. Sylvester then whispers the word Jesus in his ear, after which the bull comes back to live. Helena is instantly converted to Christianity.</li>
<li>Sylvester tames a dragon.  A dragon lived on the forum, which poisoned the air with his fumes. Sylvester prays to Mary and faces the dragon alone, armed with a silk thread and a statue of Christ. The dragon is paralyzed by the power of Christ and lets himself be bound with the silk thread. The dragon was then hit over his head with the statue and buried under the forum. The dragon probably symbolized an outbreak of Malaria in Rome.</li>
</ul>
