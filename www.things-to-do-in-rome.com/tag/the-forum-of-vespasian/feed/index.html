				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The forum of Vespasian is part of the imperial fora that Emperors build, because the forum Romanum, the main market and square of Rome became too small. The remains of these fora can be found under the main <em>Via dei Fori Imperiali, </em>which was constructed under Mussolini. In the map above you can see this main road going across with a map of the old Imperial Fora over it. Big parts of the Imperial fora are buried under the street, but because the street is one of the main traffic arteries of Rome, it will stay under ground. Recently there has been a move to pedestrianize the <em>Via dei Fori Imperiali. </em>The idea is to make the biggest archeological park of Europe, including the Colosseum, Palatine Hill, the Forum Romanum and the Imperial Fora. So far only the traffic in the street has been reduced. Taxis and busses are still allowed to pass.</p>

<p>The Forum of Vespasian is almost completely gone. You still can visit the church of the Saints Cosma and Damiano, which was built inside what probably once was the library of the Forum.</p>
