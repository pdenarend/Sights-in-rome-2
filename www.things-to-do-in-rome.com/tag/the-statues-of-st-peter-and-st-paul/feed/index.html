				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In front of the Saint Peter&#8217;s Basilica you can see two statues. They are St. Peter and St. Paul. You can recognize St. Peter by the keys in his hand, because he possesses the keys to heaven. St. Paul is always recognizable by the sword. This is because he was not crucified, but beheaded by a sword. This was his right as a roman citizen. Peter and Jesus were not roman citizens so they were crucified, which is a much more painful death. Both Peter and Paul are buried in Rome. Peter under Saint Peter’s and Paul is buried under San Paolo Fuori le Mura. The exact location of Saint Paul’s body was very recently discovered close to the altar in Saint Paul’s.</p>
