				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Higher up on the Forum Romanum you can see the Temple of Saturn. It is originally from the 5th century BC. This temple housed the treasury of the state. Also, weapons were kept here in case the Gauls would show up. Saturn was the father of Jupiter. He ruled as the highest god before him. He once heard a prophecy that one of his sons would one day take his place, so every time he fathered a son he would immediately eat him. Jupiterâ€™s mother was smart. Instead of giving Saturn his son to eat, she wrapped a stone in a cloth and Saturn ate the stone. He never found out, until Jupiter grew up and replaced him as Highest God.</p>
