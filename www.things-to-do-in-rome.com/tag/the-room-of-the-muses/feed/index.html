				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The next room from the Octagonal Courtyard is the room of the muses. You can see the muses standing with their backs to the wall all around the room. They are meant to be seen only from the front. The room was designed by Michelangelo Simonetti (a different Michelangelo) and the ceilings were frescoed by Tommaso Conca at the end of the 18th century. The muses are seven daughters of Jupiter and they represent different arts, like song and poetry. They were found in 1774 near Tivoli, a small town near Rome.</p>
<p>The statue in the middle is very important and is called the Belvedere Torso. We do not know who it represents, but this torso was of an immense influence on the art of Michelangelo. You can clearly see how. Look at the muscles and the pose. There is a lot of tension in the body. This is a technique Michelangelo would use extensively to make statues livelier. Remember the static Roman statues you have seen before? This is something else. It is an original Greek statue as you can see by the inscription in the front. It is signed with the name Apollonius. This piece was found in the 15th century at the site of the Roman baths of Caracalla near the Circus Maximus. It is believed to be Hercules, because of the lion skin he is sitting on.</p>
<p>Now try to remember this statue, because you will be able to see it about twenty times in Michelangeloâ€™s fresco of the Sistine chapel. There you will see a lot of naked figures, called Ignudi. He used these figures as some sort of decoration. You will be able to see that Michelangelo painted the torso belvedere from different positions with different heads and feet and managed to create 20 different naked figures like this. He also used for the body of Christ in his fresco of the last judgment.</p>
