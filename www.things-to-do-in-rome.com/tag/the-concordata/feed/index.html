				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This hill is one of the seven on which Rome was originally built. It is called Capitoline hill and is the smallest of the seven. The buildings you see when you stand on piazza Campidoglio were built in the renaissance, but in Roman times this hill was one of the most important places in Rome, together with Palatine hill across the forum, where the Emperors lived. On Capitoline hill the most important temple of the Roman Empire stood. It was the enormous Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, with golden roof. The foundations of the temple can still be seen inside the Capitoline Museums. Just looking at the foundations will make you realize how big the temple really was. Besides the Temple there were also smaller sanctuaries and altars. On the south side of the hill was a steep cliff from which traitors were thrown to their deaths. On the spot where now the Spartan church Santa Maria in Aracoeli stands, the temple of Juno Moneta once stood. In this temple the Roman mint was located. All the Roman coins were produced here and the English word Mint and money comes from the name of this temple: Juno Moneta.</p>
<p>After the fall of the Roman Empire, this area was left to fall apart. The temples were torn down to build new buildings and it became an insignificant hill until the renaissance, when Pope Paul III commissioned Michelangelo to redesign the hill. His design is very beautiful as you can see when you stand on Piazza del Campidoglio on top of the hill. He completely changed the focus of the hill. He made a big staircase, the cordonata, on what used to be the backside of the hill. This is because the center of Rome had changed from the Forum to the area around Piazza Navona. He designed the piazza using a strictly symmetrical floor plan.</p>
<p>Around the square you can see three public buildings. On the east side, built on top of the remains of the Tabularium, the archives of ancient Rome, stands the Palazzo Senatorio, which nowadays is the City Hall of Rome. In the middle, below the terrace, he put an antique statue, which represents Rome, which is flanked by two statues of River Gods, the Nile and the Tiber. If you come here on Sunday, you often see people getting married.</p>
<figure id="attachment_131" style="width: 274px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image057.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-131" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image057.jpg?resize=274%2C300" alt="The Concordata" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Concordata</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Concordata is the access road to the square. It has very low steps, in order to allow horses to ascend as well. At the bottom of the stairs you can see two lions, who were found in the Campus Martius, but who are from Egypt. At the top of the Concordata you can see two statues on both sides holding horses. They wear strange hats. This is because they are Castor and Pollux, sons of Leda and Jupiter. Jupiter disguised himself as a swan when he seduced Leda, so Castor and Pollux were born out of two eggs. This is why they wear an eggshell on their heads. When one of them died, Jupiter made both of them immortal and put them in the sky as the sign Gemini.</p>
<p>Halfway down the stairs you can see the small statue of Cola di Rienzo, who was a Medieval populist who wanted to restore the grandeur of ancient Rome. Until 1960 there were two cages here, one with a live wolf and one with an eagle, the two symbols of Rome. Animal rights activists managed to convince the city to stop this tradition.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image058.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-132" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image058.jpg?resize=300%2C200" alt="Capitoline Museums" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Capitoline Museums</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the south side lies Palazzo dei Conservatori and on the north side Palazzo Nuovo. The Palazzo dei Conservatori already existed, but Michelangelo gave it a new renaissance facade, which is identical to the one of Palazzo Nuovo on the other side of the square. These two palaces harbor the Capitoline Museums. They are connected to each other under the earth by a tunnel which leads through the old Roman Tabularium, under the City Hall. It was the first publicly accessible museum in the world. Clement XII opened it in 1734 for the general public.</p>
<p>If you have the time, go visit the museums. The museums have a mixed collection. You see many world famous roman statues, like the original equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius. Also, you can see the archeological excavations of the foundations of the temple of Jupiter. I sometimes go there with tour groups if it rains. It makes for a nice excursion, especially if the weather outside is not the best.</p>
<figure id="attachment_133" style="width: 225px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image059.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-133" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image059.jpg?resize=225%2C300" alt="Marcus Aurelius" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Marcus Aurelius</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the middle of the square stands the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius. It is a copy of an original which now stands inside the Capitoline Museums. The original was put here by Michelangelo and stood here for many centuries, until it was moved to protect it. The original is also made of bronze and it is just luck that it still exists. Many bronze statues were melted down, but people thought this statue represented Emperor Constantine, the first Christian Emperor, so it was saved. Later it turned out to represent Marcus Aurelius.</p>
<p>The base of the statue is the only sculpture by Michelangelo that is still standing outside. Now, if you take an Italian fifty euro cent coin, you will see this statue, together with the design on the floor. These geometrical shapes were also designed by Michelangelo, but only recently executed.</p>
