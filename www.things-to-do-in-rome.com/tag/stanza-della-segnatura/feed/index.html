				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the most famous room of Raphael, the Stanza della Segnatura, which was painted from 1508 to 1512. It was meant to become the library of Julius II, but afterwards became room where most important Papal documents were signed and sealed. So it is called the room of the Segnatura, which means signing.</p>
<p>The School of Athens is the most important in this room.  This fresco represents rational wisdom. We see a debate on the search for truth between Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle. They are the two figures in the middle both holding their most famous books in their hand. Plato holds the republic and Aristotle his Etica. Raphael gave Plato the face of Leonardo da Vinci, putting him at par with Plato. Aristotle is on his right. Many figures have the faces of Raphael’s contemporaries, but unfortunately we are not quite sure who is who. Some figures however are recognizable.</p>
<p><span id="more-722"></span></p>
<figure id="attachment_262" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image184.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-262" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image184.jpg?resize=300%2C233" alt="School of Athens by Raphael" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">School of Athens by Raphael</figcaption></figure>
<p>The bent over bald man explaining a theory with a compass has the face of Raphael’s friend Donato Bramante, the first architect to work on the new Saint Peters for Pope Julius II. The architectural space in which the figures stand is clearly inspired by Bramante’s work.</p>
<p>Raphael worked in this room at the same time Michelangelo was painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. According to legend Raphael sometimes would sneak in in to see what Michelangelo was doing and was really inspired by what he saw. So we can clearly see the influence of Michelangelo in the big figures in this fresco. He also painted Michelangelo, which is the figure sitting alone on the steps, thinking. Michelangelo was an artist who was always by himself and a bit of a loner so that’s why he is sitting by himself on the steps.</p>
<p>Raphael also added himself again, you can see him to the far right behind the guy in white (which is a portrait of Sodoma, who was his teacher). Raphael is the one with the black hat.</p>
<figure id="attachment_263" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image185.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-263" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image185.jpg?resize=300%2C225" alt="Disputation of the Holy Sacrament" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Disputation of the Holy Sacrament</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other side of the wall you can see the disputation of the holy sacrament. This one represents the other form of wisdom, which is theological wisdom. So together with the school of Athens all forms of wisdom are represented: Godly and Manly wisdom. We see Popes and Saints on earth debating about the nature of the holy sacrament and above, up in heaven the same debate is being held.</p>
