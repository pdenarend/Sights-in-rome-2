				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The St. Paul outside the Walls or San Paolo fuori le Mura, is one of the four Papal basilicas in Rome. It was founded by Emperor Constantine to mark the grave of the apostle. It was expanded and enlarged in the following centuries, until it became even bigger than the old Saint Peter’s. The current Saint Peter’s Basilica of course is bigger. It is called outside the walls, because the grave of the apostle was outside of the city walls of Rome. Saint Paul was martyred using a sword. This was his right, because he was a Roman citizen. Jesus and Peter were not so they were crucified. Paul is almost always depicted with a sword in his hands.</p>

<figure id="attachment_334" style="width: 465px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image252.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-334" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image252.jpg?resize=465%2C750" alt="Saint Paul" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Saint Paul</figcaption></figure>
<p>In front of the church you can see Saint Paul, holding a sword in his hands. He stands in a portico that is a neoclassical addition to the church.</p>
<h2>The doors of Saint Paul outside the Walls</h2>
<figure id="attachment_335" style="width: 418px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image253.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-335" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image253.jpg?resize=418%2C557" alt="The doors of Saint Paul outside the Walls" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The doors of Saint Paul outside the Walls</figcaption></figure>
<figure id="attachment_336" style="width: 404px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image254.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-336" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image254.jpg?resize=404%2C572" alt="The Holy Door" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Holy Door</figcaption></figure>
<p>The door of the church is from the 20th century. This church has also a Holy door, on the right side. This door is only opened during a Jubilee Year, which takes place every 25 years. The Jubilee year was instituted by the Borgia Pope Alexander VI, to make some extra money, but it was such a success that it was repeated every 25 years afterwards.</p>
<h2><em>The Interior of Saint Paul</em></h2>
<figure id="attachment_337" style="width: 624px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image255.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-337" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image255.jpg?resize=624%2C533" alt="The Interior of Saint Paul" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Interior of Saint Paul</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 1823 a fire started because of the negligence of a workman who was repairing the roof. The basilica was almost completely destroyed. Afterwards it was completely restored, so the current building dates from the 19th century. The new basilica has maintained its original structure with one nave and four aisles. It is the second largest church in Rome.</p>
<p>All around you can see the portraits of all the Popes, starting with Saint Peter and ending with Benedict XVI. There are only a few empty spots left and no one knows what to do if they are full.</p>
<h2>The Apse of Saint Paul</h2>
<figure id="attachment_338" style="width: 624px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image256.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-338" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image256.jpg?resize=624%2C468" alt="The Apse of Saint Paul" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Apse of Saint Paul</figcaption></figure>
<p>The apse and the triumphal arch are the only things left from the original basilica, the rest is 19th century. The 5th century mosaics on the Triumphal arch are original, the rest is a reconstruction.</p>
<figure id="attachment_339" style="width: 623px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image257.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-339" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image257.jpg?resize=623%2C428" alt="The cloister of Saint Paul" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The cloister of Saint Paul</figcaption></figure>
<p>South of the transept is the cloister, considered one of the most beautiful of the middle ages. It has double columns of different shapes, some with glass mosaic.</p>
<p>According to tradition, the church was built on top of the grave of Saint Paul, but nobody knew for sure. In 2006, Vatican archaeologists announced the discovery of a white sarcophagus below the main altar. In 2009 Pope Benedict announced that the skeleton inside had been carbon dated and came from the 1th or 2nd century AD. This seemed to confirm that the bones in the sarcophagus are actually Saint Paul’s. His head is kept in Saint John of Lateran though.</p>
