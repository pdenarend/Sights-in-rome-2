				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Santa Maria in Trastevere is the first church that was dedicated to Maria and according to locals the first church where Christians held public mass. The first Christians came from the Jewish community, who lived in Trastevere. The current church dates from 1140 and was built with stones from the baths of Caracalla. The mosaic on the facade is from also from that time. We see Mary on a throne surrounded by five female figures that hold small lamps. A burning flame means they are virgins, if there is no flame they are widows. Mary gives milk to baby Jesus using a small milk bottle. A bottle was used because people thought a naked breast would not be proper to put on the facade of a church.</p>

<h2>Portico</h2>
<p>In the portico you can see all sorts of Roman inscriptions. Most of them come from Christian graves. Marcus Cocceius for example explains to us on his grave that he had been married for 45 years and 11 days without fighting a single day.</p>
<h2>Interior</h2>
<p>The form of the church is that of an antique basilica. A basilica used to be a courtroom in Roman times, and the early Christians used this type of building to build their first churches. This is because a basilica was much more adept to hold mass than a pagan temple. It is a rectangular building. The columns were stolen from pagan temples and you can see that they are all different.</p>
<h2>Saint Antony of Padua</h2>
<p>On the left there is a statue of Saint Antony of Padua with a small baby Jesus on his arm. People believe this statue performs miracles, so there are many pleas written on small pieces of paper next to its base.</p>
<h2>Apse Mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere</h2>
<figure id="attachment_316" style="width: 602px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image235.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-316" src="http://i2.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image235.jpg?resize=602%2C603" alt="Apse Mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Apse Mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the apse you can see a beautiful mosaic from the 12th and 13th century. Jesus sits together with Mary on a throne. Lambs walk from Bethlehem on the right and Jerusalem on the left towards the Lamb of God. Also, scenes from the life of Mary can be seen. The birth of Mary is represented with two figures of midwives.</p>
<p>The floor is a Cosmatique work. The Cosmati were a family from the 12th century who laid mosaic floors with pieces of antique marble.</p>
<p>On the right in the nave is the empty grave of Francesco Armellini Medici. He was a hated cardinal, who taxed the population very much. Because of this, he became very rich and had this funerary monument built. When Rome was sacked by the troops of Charles V in 1527 he had to flee to the Castel Santâ€™Angelo. He then lost his fortune and was buried without honor somewhere else.</p>
