				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next to the Colosseum you can see the Arch of Constantine. It was built in honor of Emperor Constantine. He was one the most important figures in western history. He was the first Emperor that became Christian. Historians are not quite sure if he ever was baptized. Most people believe he was baptized just before dying, because the Emperor thought it was impossible to be a good Christian and a good Emperor at the same time. This is the last monument built in classical Rome, because Emperor Constantine soon moved the capital to a new city on the Bosporus, which came to be known as Constantinople, now Istanbul.</p>
<p>Constantine became Christian because the day before an important battle he had a dream in which he saw a cross. An angel then told him ‘In hoc signo vinces’ or in this sign you will conquer. The next day Constantine ordered all his soldiers to paint crosses on their shield and of course he won the battle and became the sole Emperor. Afterwards he started sponsoring Christianity. He ordered the building of Saint Peter’s Basilica and Saint John of Lateran. He also presided over Church councils, like the one in Milan, in which Christianity was legalized. Constantine’s influence was enormous. Before Constantine about 5% of the population of the empire was Christian, after Constantine about 60 to 70% of the population were Christian.</p>
<p>This arch was made by using parts of older arches, celebrating other Emperors. Only the carvings just above the arches have something to do with Constantine. Elsewhere we see for example hunting scenes from the time of Hadrian. The inscription says ‘The senate and the people of Rome devote this arch to Constantine, because he liberated the state from tyranny and infighting thanks to his godly inspiration and greatness of his mind.</p>
