				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santa Maria dell’Anima is the German church. You can find it just behind Piazza Navona. Around this church the German pilgrims used to stay when they came to Rome. In the church is also the grave of the last non-Italian Pope before John Paul II. He was Hadrian VI and he was Dutch. He was made Pope because of the influence of his employer and student, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. His pontificate was not a success. He was way too strict for the Romans to handle. They were used to Popes like Alexander VI and Julius II, who had children and were more like renaissance princes. Everybody was very relieved when Hadrian died very soon. Signs of gratitude were put at the door of the Popes physician, who had not been able (or wanting) to save him.</p>
