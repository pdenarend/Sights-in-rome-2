				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Santa Maria Maggiore is one of the four papal basilicas of Rome and is also Vatican territory. It was built on the top of Esquiline hill, because of a dream of a Pope. In his dream, Pope Liberius was visited by an angel, who told him to build a church on top of the hill where snow would fall the next day. Of course, it was the middle of August, and snow does not normally fall at that time of the year. But the Pope woke up and saw that snow had fallen on top of Esquiline hill. He went over and discovered that the owner of the land had had the same dream. They then decided to build the church. This was in the 4th century. Every august this event is remembered by throwing white flowers in the air on August the 5th. The campanile, the bell tower, is a Romanesque structure from the 14th century. The facade is both baroque and medieval. If you stand in front of the Church, you can see that a newer, baroque facade is built around the older one. You can still see the medieval mosaic on what used to be the facade.</p>
<p>On the square in front of the church stands a Corinthian column, which came from Constantine&#8217;s Basilica on the Forum. On top, a bronze statue of Mary was put in 1614.</p>
<p><span id="more-510"></span></p>
<p>The facade was built in 1744, but through it you can still see the mosaic from the 1300s on the original facade. The mosaic tells the story of the dream and the snow. You can see Maria, Pope Liberius and the owner of the land on which the snow fell. On the right you can see the Pope drawing the design of the church in the snow. Unfortunately, it is very hard to see the mosaics well from down on the piazza.</p>
<p>The campanile is the highest in Rome. It is 75 meters high. Every day at half past nine the bells ring to help lost travelers with their orientation.</p>
<h2>Entrance of Santa Maria Maggiore</h2>
<p>In the entrance hall you can see on your right a statue of Philip IV of Spain, who awarded the church a yearly contribution. Ever since, Spanish kings give money to this church. On the right you can see the Porta Sancta, the holy door that is only opened in a Holy year by the Pope himself.</p>
<h2>The Interior of Santa Maria Maggiore</h2>
<figure id="attachment_311" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image230.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-311" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image230.jpg?resize=600%2C497" alt="The Interior of Santa Maria Maggiore" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Interior of Santa Maria Maggiore</figcaption></figure>
<p>The interior consists of a monumental mix of styles. The beautiful floor is a Cosmatesque work. The Cosmati were a family who were renowned in this area for their way of making beautiful floors. They use pieces of stone and glass to create geometric mosaics on church floors</p>
<p>The columns are still the original ones from the 5th century church. Also have a look at the renaissance ceiling. It is one of the most beautiful ceilings in Rome and is decorated with the first gold that was brought from America by Columbus. It was a gift from King Ferdinand of Aragon</p>
<p>Above the nave you can see 28 small mosaics from the 5th century with biblical stories.</p>
<h2>Crypt of the Nativity</h2>
<figure id="attachment_312" style="width: 600px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image231.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-312" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image231.jpg?resize=600%2C450" alt="Crypt of the Nativity" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Crypt of the Nativity</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the area under the high altar a very important relic is being kept in the Crypt of the Nativity. It is the Holy Manger in which Christ was laid down after he was born. You can see the old pieces of wood in a silver and glass urn. Pope Theodor I took it from Bethlehem to Rome in the 7th century. The pieces of the manger are taken in procession through the church, every year on Christmas eve. The statue of the praying Pope represents Pope Pius IX from the 19th century. This crypt is also the burial place of Saint Jerome, one of the Doctors of the Church, who translated the bible in Latin in the 4th century.</p>
<h2>Apse Mosaic</h2>
<p>In the mosaic on the arch above the altar you can see four stories from the life of Mary: the annunciation, the adoration of the Magi, the Presentation of Mary  and the Flight to Egypt. The apse mosaic is from 1295 and made by Franciscan friar Jacopo Torriti, who dated and signed it. The main theme is the Triumph of Mary. Mary sits next to Christ as his equal in heaven. The Franciscans claimed for a very long time that Mary, after her death, ascended immediately to heaven. This dogma was only made official by Pope Pius IX in 1854.</p>
<h2>The Borghese Chapel</h2>
<p>The Borghese Chapel is located on the far left. It was built in 1611 and named after Pope Paul V of the Borghese family. Pauline Bonaparte, Napoleon’s sister, is buried here in the Borghese Crypt, but you cannot see her grave. The painting of the Madonna with child above the altar would have been painted by Saint Luke himself and finished by angels. The painting was already used in processions through Rome in 590 by Pope Gregory the Great to stop an epidemic of the pest.</p>
<figure id="attachment_313" style="width: 355px;" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image232.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-313" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.things-to-do-in-rome.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/image232.jpg?resize=355%2C533" alt="Sistine Chapel of Santa Maria Maggiore" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Sistine Chapel of Santa Maria Maggiore</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the Santa Maria Maggiore there is also a Sistine Chapel. It is the last big chapel on the right. It was named after Pope Sixtus V, and not after Sixtus IV who commissioned the other, more famous Sistine Chapel at the Vatican. It was built in the 16th century by Domenico Fontana. You can see a tabernacle from the 16th century here which is supported by four bronze angels. There are also some Papal graves here. On the left and right Pius V and Sixtus V are buried. Sixtus V was a very tough Pope. On the bas relief on his grave you see a depiction of the heads of highwaymen that are brought into the city after a Papal campaign against them. On one day he could hang 60 of them, while he was watching and having dinner.</p>
<p>Just outside the Sistine chapel is the humble grave of Gian Lorenzo Bernini.</p>
<h2>The baptistery</h2>
<p>The baptistery is located in the front of the church on the right side. Against the left wall of the chapel you can see a bust of a black man. It is the grave of Antonio Emanuele Funta, who was an ambassador from the Kingdom of the Congo, who was sent to Rome in 1604. His trip took two years and a year after he arrived he died.</p>
<h2>Chapel of Santi Michele e Pietro in Vincoli</h2>
<p>From here you can access a souvenir shop on the left in the Chapel of Santi Michele e Pietro in Vincoli. The floors in this chapel are especially noteworthy. It is a brilliant example of Cosmatesque work. None of the patterns on the floor is the same. This is to express the uniqueness of God.</p>
