				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a very important piece in the Octagonal courtyard. Many renaissance and baroque artists used this statue in their own work. Look at the face of Apollo. Later when you will be in the Sistine chapel you will see this face again. Michelangelo copied this face to use for his Jesus figure in his fresco of the last judgment. Look closely so you will remember. He thought the face was one of perfect male beauty and that is why he used it.</p>
<p>The statue is called Apollo Belvedere. Apollo was the sun-god and the god of reason and arts. He was second only to Zeus. In one hand he has a bow and the other an arrow, because the romans believed that if a person suddenly dropped dead he was struck down by one of Apolloâ€™s arrows. Now of course we know this can caused by a heart attack for example.</p>
<p>These pieces date back to the 2nd century AD, but it is a copy of a lost Greek bronze from the 4th century BC. It is roman made. We can see this because the roman sculptors were not as good as the Greek ones, so for example this one needs a little tree trunk to keep standing.</p>
<p>This piece was taken by Napoleon to Paris in 1797 and later returned in 1815 after the battle of the Waterloo. Gian Lorenzo Bernini was also inspired by this statue and used it in his Apollo and Daphne, the amazing statue that is now in the Galleria Borghese.</p>
