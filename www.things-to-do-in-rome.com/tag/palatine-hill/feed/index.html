				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Behind the Arch you can see Palatine hill. This is one of the seven hills on which Rome was built and it was here that everything started. According to legend this was the place Romulus and Remus were nursed by the wolf. Romulus would go on and become Rome’s first king, after murdering his brother. Afterwards this became the place where the Emperors and noble families had their houses. This tradition was started by the first Emperor, Augustus, who built a relatively simple house on the hill, to associate him with the founder of Rome, Romulus. Later Emperors built much bigger palaces on the hill. The English word palace comes from the word Palatinus. The hill is 50 meters high and archaeological evidence shows that the first settlement in this area was in fact on this hill, around 1000 BC.</p>
<p>The last Emperor of the Flavian family was Domitian, the brother of the well-loved Titus. He became crazy with power. He built an enormous palace on palatine hill overlooking the Forum and proclaimed himself a god during his lifetime. He was constantly afraid to be murdered, so he had the walls of his palace made out of polished marble, which had an effect like a mirror. This way he could always see if someone would sneak up behind him to kill him. In the end he was murdered in his bathroom, because there was no polished marble there.</p>
<p>Later Emperors expanded Domitian’s palace. It used to extend across Palatine hill and overlooked the Circus Maximus. The building of the part that is still visibly overlooking the circus was built during the reign of Septimus Severus at the beginning of the 3rd century.</p>
<p>Next to the palace of Severus is the so-called Hippodrome of Domitian. It looks like a Roman circus but is in fact too small to hold chariot races. It was probably a stadium for athletic competitions, like sprinting. One of the first martyrs, Saint Sebastian, is said to be clubbed to death on palatine hill, after first being pierced by arrows.</p>
