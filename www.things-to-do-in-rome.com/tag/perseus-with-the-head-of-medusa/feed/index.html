				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These statues are all neo-classical pieces by Antonio Canova made in the 1800’s. When Napoleon conquered Italy his troops stole the famous ancient statues from the octagonal courtyard and took them to Paris. To replace them, this statue was put here, a masterpiece by Antonio Canova. It represents the story of the medusa. The medusa was a monster. She was a woman with snakes for hair. If you would look into her eyes you would turn into stone. Many warriors and heroes had come and tried to kill her but all had been turned into stone. Then came the Greek hero Perseus. He was smart. He never looked for medusa but instead looked into the reflection of his sword. This way he could see where she was and like this he managed to cut off her head.</p>

<p>The boxers in front of them are Kreugas and Damoxenos, also by Antonio Canova. During a match Damoxenos stabbed Kreugas and pulled out his intestines so he was automatically disqualified and the dead Kreugas was named the winner.</p>
<p>After Napoleon was conquered Antonio Canova was sent to Paris as an ambassador to try to get the stolen statues back. He managed to get them back and as a reward his own statue was allowed to remain in the octagonal courtyard which was an enormous honor.</p>
